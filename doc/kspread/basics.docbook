<title>&kspread; Basics</title>

<note><para>Like the rest of &kde;, &kspread; is highly configurable, which can
cause problems for readers trying to compare the text in a document such as
this with what they see on the version of &kspread; running on their desktop.
To cut down on some of the possibilities for confusion, it it suggested that
when you first start to use &kspread; you set the default options in all pages
of the &kspread; configuration dialog (obtained by selecting
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
&kspread;...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>) except for <guilabel>Completion mode:
</guilabel> in the <guisubmenu>Misc</guisubmenu> page, which should be set to
<guimenuitem>None</guimenuitem>.
</para>
<para>You may also find it helpful to globally <guilabel>Enable tooltips</guilabel> 
in &kcontrolcenter; in <menuchoice><guimenu>Appearance &amp;
Themes</guimenu><guimenuitem>Style</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
on the <guilabel>Style</guilabel> page. </para></note>

<title>Spreadsheets for Beginners</title>

<para>This section attempts to explain by example what a spreadsheet program
such as &kspread; actually does, and why it is such a useful tool in any
situation where you have to deal with numbers. If you have already used a
spreadsheet program you may wish to skip to the next section.</para>

<para>The first thing to do is to start up &kspread;. You can do this by
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> clicking on a &kspread; icon if there is one
on your desktop or panel, or you can select
<menuchoice><guimenu>Office</guimenu><guimenuitem>&kspread;</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
from the K menu.</para>

<para>

When it has started you will be given the choice of opening a recent
document, creating a new document from a template (with templates categories) or
opening an existing document . Select the <guilabel>General</guilabel> category
on the left and choose the <guilabel>Blank Worksheet</guilabel> template. Then
click the <guibutton>Use This Template</guibutton> button.</para>

<para>Looking at &kspread; once it has started up, you will see a sheet of
empty rectangular cells arranged in numbered rows and lettered columns. This
is where you enter data or formula, text or charts.

<phrase>Screenshot starting1</phrase>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</para>
<para>Now, enter the text and values shown in the first 5 rows of the above
screenshot into the same cells of your spreadsheet. Ignore what is in row 7
for the moment. To enter anything into a cell first select the cell by
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> clicking inside it, then type whatever you
want, then press <keycap>Enter</keycap> or use the arrow keys to move the
selection point to another cell.
</para>
<para>What we have entered so far could be a simple budget for the next two
months, listing how much we think we will be spending for Food, Shelter,
Clothing and any Other expenditure. Now select cell B7 (column B, row 7), 
type in <userinput>=B2+B3+B4+B5</userinput> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>. 
Because it begins with a <keycap>=</keycap> symbol &kspread; sees this as a 
formula, something it has to calculate, in this case by adding together the 
values in the 4 cells B2 to B5, and what is shown in the cell B7 is the result 
of that calculation.</para>
<para>You could enter a similar formula into cell C7, except that in this case
it would have to be <userinput>=C2+C3+C4+C5</userinput>, but there is an
easier way which is to Copy cell B7 and Paste it into C7. &kspread; will
automatically adjust the cell references from B.. to C.. when the Paste is
done.</para>
<para>At this point you may think that &kspread; is doing no more than you
could manage with pencil, paper and a calculator, and you could be right, but
remember that this is a very small example of a spreadsheet, doing simple
calculations on only a few numbers. For any reasonably amount of values or data
using a spreadsheet to do the calculations is much quicker and more accurate
than doing them manually.</para>
<para>Also, a spreadsheet lets you play the <quote>What if?</quote> game.
Because each formula is automatically recalculated whenever any of the values
it refers to are changed, you can quickly see what happens if you alter any of
them. Using our example you can see the effect of reducing the amount spent on
food in December by just entering a new value into cell C2. If you had a
spreadsheet that modelled the greenhouse effect accurately you could perhaps
see the effect of a 50 percent reduction in the amount of methane released 
into the atmosphere.</para>

<sect1 id="selecting">
<title>Selecting Cells</title>
<para>You can select a single cell or a rectangular area of cells in the 
spreadsheet. The selected cell(s) are displayed with a thick black border.
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<title>You can select a single cell in one of the following ways</title>
<listitem><para><mousebutton>left</mousebutton> click on it</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>enter the cell reference (for example <userinput>B5</userinput>)
into the cell reference box at the left end of the Formula toolbar and press
<keycap>Enter</keycap></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>use the <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Goto
Cell...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu option</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>You can also steer your way around with the <keysym>arrow</keysym> keys.
Pressing the <keysym>Enter</keysym> key will move the current selection one
position up, down, left or right depending on the setting in the <guilabel>Misc
</guilabel> page of &kspread;'s <link linkend="configmisc">configuration dialog
box</link>.</para> <para>If you hold the <keycombo
action="simul">&Shift;</keycombo> key down while using the
<keysym>arrow</keysym> keys the selection will move to the start or end of the
block of occupied cells.</para>
<para>To select an area of contiguous cells drag the mouse cursor across the
desired area with the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> button held down, or enter
the references of the top left and bottom right cells separated by a colon into
the Formula toolbar cell reference box (for example <userinput>B7:C14
</userinput>) and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>, or enter these cell references
in a similar format into the dialog box brought up by <menuchoice><guimenu>
View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Goto Cell...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>
<para>You can also select an area of cells by selecting the cell in one corner
of the wanted area then holding the <keycombo
action="simul">&Shift; </keycombo> key down while using the
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button to select the cell in the opposite
corner.</para>

<para>To select a complete row or column of cells <mousebutton>left
</mousebutton> click on the row number at the left of the worksheet or on the 
column letters at the top. To select adjacent rows or columns drag the mouse 
pointer over the appropriate row numbers or column letters with the 
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> button held down.</para>

<para>To select non-contiguous cells, click on the first cell you want to select
then hold the <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;</keycombo> key and select the other
cells.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="entering">
<title>Entering Data</title>
<para>Entering data into a cell can be as simple as selecting the cell, typing 
your data, then pressing <keycap>Enter</keycap> or moving the selection to 
another cell with one of the <keysym>arrow</keysym> keys. Depending on how you 
enter the data, &kspread; will interpret it as a number, date, time or text:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Numbers are entered in the obvious way; <userinput>123</userinput>, <userinput>
-123</userinput>, <userinput>456.7</userinput> or in scientific notation 
<userinput>-1.2E-5</userinput>.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Dates should be entered in your <quote>System</quote> format, as defined in 
the &kcontrolcenter; in <menuchoice><guimenu>
Regional &amp; Accessibility</guimenu> <guisubmenu>
Country/Region &amp; Language</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Time &amp; Dates</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> dialog box.  If, for example, you are using the DD/MM/YYYY form 
you should enter <userinput>30/03/2002</userinput> for 30th March 2002. 
Leading zeroes can be omitted from the day and month fields and only the last
one or two digits of the year need to be entered if the date is in the current 
century, for example <userinput>9/1/2</userinput> for 9th January 2002. 
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Times should also be entered using the <quote>System</quote> format. For 
example if you are using a 12 hour clock then enter times in HH:MIN am|pm or 
HH:MIN:SS am|pm format such as <userinput>9:42 am</userinput> or <userinput>
10:30:52 pm</userinput>.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
&kspread; defines any input data as <quote>text</quote> if it cannot 
recognize the data as being a number, date or time.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<note><para>By default, &kspread; right justifies numbers, dates and times 
within a cell and left justifies anything else. This can be a useful guide 
to whether you have entered a date or time in the correct format. But 
remember that how items are displayed can be changed by altering 
the <link linkend="formatdata">cell format</link>.</para></note>

<para>The main text entry box in the Formula toolbar provides an easy way of 
editing the contents of a selected cell. Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> or 
<mousebutton>left</mousebutton> click on the green tick mark when you are 
happy with what you have entered, or click on the red cross to cancel your 
edits.</para>

<sect2 id="genericformat">
<title>Generic Cell Format</title>
<para>
&kspread; uses the <quote>Generic</quote> cell format as default. As long
as this format is used, &kspread; autodetects the actual data type depending
on the current cell data. For example if you enter some text into a cell and
later enter a number into the same cell, &kspread; automatically interprets
the new data as a number. If you want to define the type of data yourself, you
can explicitly set it in the <link linkend="formatdata">cell format</link>.
You can change the format back to <quote>Generic</quote> at any time.

<sect1 id="copypaste">
<title>Copy, Cut and Paste</title>

<para>At first glance, &kspread;'s <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem>, 
<guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> appear 
to be similar to these functions in other &kde; applications. Having selected 
a cell or cells, you can choose <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> or 
<guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu or from
the drop down menu you get by holding the <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> 
mouse button down on a selected cell. You can also use the shortcuts 
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>C</keycap>
</keycombo> or <keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>X</keycap>
</keycombo>, then move the selection to the target cell and choose 
<guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> or press <keycombo action="simul">
&Ctrl;<keycap>V</keycap></keycombo>. However there are some 
subtleties associated with these functions in &kspread; and these are discussed 
below.</para>

<para>If a cell contains a formula then the formula itself is copied rather 
than the displayed result, and if the formula contains a reference to another 
cell, then that reference is changed by the <guimenuitem>Cut</guimenuitem> 
or <guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> and <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> 
operation to point to the cell that is in the same relative position as in 
the original cell. For example if cell A2 contains the formula <userinput>
=B3</userinput> and is copied to C4, cell C4 will contain <userinput>=D5
</userinput>.</para>
<para>This may seem to be a rather strange way of doing a copy, but 
99 percent of the time it is exactly what is wanted (if it is not then see the 
section about <link linkend="absolute">absolute cell references</link>). 
For example in the simple shopping list shown below, cell D2 should contain 
<userinput>=B2 * C2</userinput>, D3 should be <userinput>=B3 * C3</userinput>, 
D4 should be <userinput>=B4 * C4</userinput> and so on. Instead of having to 
enter a different formula in each cell, you can just enter the first formula 
into D2 and then copy it into the cells below, letting &kspread; adjust the 
cell references to suit.</para>

<sect2 id="copypasteareas">
<title>Copying and Pasting Cell Areas</title>
<para>In the above example D2 can be copied into all three cells D3 to D5 at 
once by just copying D2 then selecting the complete cell area D3:D5 before 
doing the paste.</para>
<para>A rectangular area of cells can be cut or copied in one operation by 
selecting the area before doing the cut or copy. Then select the top left 
corner cell of the area you want to paste into before doing the paste.</para>
<para>If you cut or copy a rectangular area of cells, say B2:C3, and paste it 
into a larger area such as A10:D13 the original pattern of cells will be 
repeated to fill the target area.</para>
<para>&kspread; also provides a <quote>Drag and Copy</quote> method for 
copying cells down into other cells immediately below or to the 
right of the original cell(s). To use this method select the cell(s) to be 
copied then position the mouse pointer over the small black square at the 
bottom right corner of the selected cell(s) so the cursor changes to a double 
headed arrow. Then hold the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> mouse button down 
while you drag the selected cell(s) as far as you wish. Note that cell
references in formulae are incremented according to the
relative position change. Absolute references are not changed.</para>

<title>Other Paste Modes</title>
<para>A cell may contain text, a value, or a formula, and may also contain 
special font, border or background <link linkend="formatspread">formatting 
information</link>. &kspread; has special versions of Paste that let 
you handle these items in different ways.</para>

<para><menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Special
Paste...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>brings up the <guilabel> Special
Paste</guilabel> dialog box. By selecting the appropriate item from
the top part of this dialog you can choose to paste just
<guilabel>Text </guilabel>, the cell <guilabel>Format</guilabel>, any
<guilabel>Comment </guilabel> in the cell(s) or <guilabel>Everything
without border</guilabel>. The items in the bottom part of this dialog
box allow you to do simple <link linkend="sumspecialpaste">arithmetic
on an area of cells</link>.
</para>

<para><guimenuitem>Paste with Insertion...</guimenuitem> inserts the copied 
cell(s) into the sheet by moving the cells that would otherwise be overwritten 
a suitable number of rows of columns down or to the right. It can also be used 
to insert complete copied row(s) or column(s) into the worksheet.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="simplesums">
<title>Simple Sums</title>
<para>If the first character in a cell is an equals sign (<keycap>=</keycap>) 
&kspread; will take the cell contents to be a formula which is to be  
calculated. The result of the calculation will be displayed in the cell rather 
than the formula itself. For example, enter <userinput>=2+3</userinput> 
into a cell and it should display <emphasis>5</emphasis>.</para>
<para>More usefully, a formula can contain references to other cells, so 
that <userinput>=B4+A3</userinput> will calculate the sum of the values in 
cells B4 and A3, and this calculation will be updated whenever cells B4 or A3 
are changed.</para>
<para>As well as addition, a formula can make use of the <keycap>-</keycap>
symbol for subtraction, <keycap>*</keycap> for multiplication, and <keycap>
/</keycap> to perform division. The round bracket symbols <keycap>(</keycap> 
and <keycap>)</keycap> can also be used as in normal algebra, so you could 
enter more complex formulae such as <userinput>=((B10 + C3) *5 - F11) / 2
</userinput>.</para>

<para>Cells containing a formula will be marked with a small blue triangle 
at the bottom left corner if the <guilabel>Show formula indicator</guilabel>

<para>&kspread; also includes a large number of built-in functions for 
applications such as statistical, trigonometrical and financial calculations. 
Their use will be examined in more depth in a <link linkend="formulas">
later section</link> of this manual, but if you are interested at this stage 
choose <guimenuitem>Function...</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Insert
</guimenu> menu and take a look through the <guilabel>Function
</guilabel> dialog box that will be displayed..</para>
<para>For the time being, however, the <userinput>SUM</userinput> function may 
be of interest as it calculates the sum of all values in a specified area of 
cells. For example <userinput>=SUM(B4:C10)</userinput> calculates the sum of 
all values in the cell area B4 to C10.</para>
<para>If &kspread; displays a row of <keycap>#</keycap> symbols when you have 
entered your formula this usually means that it cannot understand what 
you have entered, but if the row of <keycap>#</keycap> symbols ends with a 
small red arrow this just means that the cell is not wide enough to display 
the complete result, in which case you should either make the cell(s) wider 
or change their <link linkend="formatdata">format</link> so that the result 
does fit properly.</para>

current document. It does this by automatically saving the latest version of 
the document you are working on every few minutes using a modified file name. 
The autosaved version is normally removed when you next save your document, 
so that it will only exist if it is more up to date than the version that was
saved manually.
When you open a document &kspread; checks to see if an autosaved
version exists, and if it finds one it will offer to open that instead.</para>
<para>Autosaved documents are saved with a file name of the form
<filename>.yourfilename.autosave</filename> (note the leading period),
so that <filename>spread1.ods</filename> would be autosaved as
<filename>.spread1.ods.autosave</filename>. The autosave feature is
user configurable in the <link linkend="configinterface">settings dialog</link>.</para>

<sect2 id="templates">
<title>Templates</title>
<para>If you are going to be creating a lot of similar documents you can
save yourself time and trouble by first creating a template and then
using that as the basis for the individual documents.</para>
<para>To do this first create a document containing the common elements,
then save it as a template by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Create Template From Document...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
Doing this opens the <guilabel>Create Template</guilabel> dialog box.
Enter a name for your new template into the <guilabel>Name:</guilabel> text
box and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. The next time you start a new
document by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>New
</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or when you next start &kspread; the 
startup dialog window will give you the option of creating the
new document from your template.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Create Template</guilabel> dialog box also lets you
choose a different picture to be displayed above the template name in the
startup dialog window, and lets you save your templates
under different group names, which will appear as different pages in
the dialog.</para>

<sect1 id="printing">
<title>Printing a Spreadsheet</title>
<para>Printing a spreadsheet is basically done by selecting <menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Print...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> which
brings up &kde;'s common <guilabel>Print</guilabel> dialog box where you can
choose, among other options, the printer to be used, the number of copies and
whether all or only selected pages are to be printed.</para>
<para>By default &kspread; will print all items in the current worksheet, but
you can restrict this by first selecting the area that you want to be
printed then choosing <guimenuitem>Define Print Range</guimenuitem> from the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Format</guimenu><guisubmenu>Print Range</guisubmenu>
</menuchoice> sub menu.</para>
<para>&kspread; will print as many pages as are necessary to include all
items in the current worksheet. You can quickly see how a worksheet will be
spilt into separate pages for printing by checking the <menuchoice><guimenu>
View</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Show Page Borders</guimenuitem></menuchoice> box. The boundaries
of each printed page will then be marked by colored lines in the
worksheet.</para>

<para>For a more detailed view of what is to be sent to the printer, including
anything you have asked to be included in the page headers and footers (see
below), choose <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Print
Preview...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.</para>

<para>To improve the appearance of the printed output , you can change the
fonts, colors, borders and sizes of the cells in the worksheet, see the
<link linkend="formatspread">Spreadsheet Formatting</link> section for more
details about how to do this.</para>

<para>You can also use the <guilabel>Page Layout</guilabel> dialog box,
invoked by selecting <menuchoice><guimenu>Format</guimenu><guimenuitem>Page
Layout...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, to change the orientation of the printed
pages, the paper size (this should be suitable for your printer) and the size
of the page borders.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Header &amp; Footer</guilabel> page of the <guilabel>
Page Layout</guilabel> dialog box also lets you add text, including items such
as the filename, date and page number to the header and footer, of each
printed page.</para>
<para>The <guilabel>Ranges</guilabel> section of the <guilabel>Options
</guilabel> page of the <guilabel>Page Layout</guilabel> dialog box provides
an alternative way of restricting the printed output to just one part of the
worksheet and allows you to repeat selected column(s) or row(s) on each printed
page. This page also lets you select whether or not to print the grid,
comment indicators and formula indicators, objects and charts.
In the section <guilabel>Scale Printout</guilabel> you can set a scalefactor 
or limit the number of pages for the print.</para>
