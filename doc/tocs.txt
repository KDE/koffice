KOffice 2.0 TOC proposal
------------------------


Preface

This document gives some suggestions about what the KOffice documentation
should contain, in the form of annotated tables of contents. The TOCs have
been compiled from
- thoughts
- the current manual contents
- the guides for OpenOffice.org as published by the OOoAuthors initiative

The current status of the documentation should be available in the file
status.txt in the same directory as this file.

Contributors to this document:
- Sander Koning (KOffice documentation coordinator) <sanderkoning@kde.nl>
- Thomas Zander <zander@kde.org>

Comments and suggestions are more than welcome, either as SVN commits, or as
e-mails to <sanderkoning@kde.nl>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general

An application manual should be divided into three (four) parts:

- the first chapters describe base technologies (working with text, working
  with frames, working with layers, etc.). Start off with a global
  introduction (say, 2 pages) that newbees can read and then skip the rest of
  the respective chapter.

- the next couple of chapters are based on use cases, having one chapter per
  use case. A use case can be "Create a booklet for my kid with lots of
  graphics" (google for "pig in the box" for example).

- the following chapters form the reference guide. Describe the menus,
  toolbars, etcetera - in a professional, but legible way.

- if any technical, application-specific information needs to be included, do
  so in appendices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To-do

We still need:
- proper, clear, and serious names for the three main parts
  (Working with $APP, Examples, Reference Guide?)
- a standardised way of sectioning the reference guide
- technologies and usecases for all applications

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KOffice

Introduction to what KOffice is, how to use the user interface that is common
to all applications, how to set general configuration options, where to get
more information.

Since this handbook describes the overall framework, it may as an exception
derive from the general layout noted above.
