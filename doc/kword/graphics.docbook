<para>&kword; is very good at handling textual information.  &kword; can also be used to incorporate
graphical images with text.  </para>
<tip><para>A source of great clipart that is free to use is the <ulink url="http://www.openclipart.org">Open Clip Art Library</ulink>. This project has a large collection of vector graphics indexed and sorted by category, all released into the public domain.</para></tip>
<para>Pictures can be inserted into a document as either <emphasis>framed</emphasis> or <emphasis>inline</emphasis> images.</para>
<para>Framed images are pictures that have a frame around them.  The frame around a picture functions 
exactly the same as a frame around text.  It contains the picture and determines the size and shape of the picture.</para>
<para>An inline image has a frame around it, but this frame is inserted <emphasis>within</emphasis> the current text
frame. If text is inserted in front of the picture, the picture travels down the frame just like any text would.  This means the picture will
stay in the same area of the page as the text that surrounds it.</para>
<para>Framed pictures, on the other hand, need to be moved by hand on the page.  </para>

<para>&kword; can use pictures <link linkend="insert-graphics">already stored in a file</link> or <link linkend="scan-graphics"> acquire an image from a scanner</link>.</para>

<para>There are three ways to insert a picture into a document:</para>

<para>Select your resolution using the drop down box labeled <guilabel>Resolution</guilabel></para>
<para>Now place the object you want to scan in the scanner and click <guibutton>Preview Scan</guibutton>.  Your scanner will take a low resolution

<para>You can refer to the box to the left of the preview window labeled <guilabel>Selection</guilabel>.  This box will show you the height and 
width of your selection and the amount of disk space you will need to store this image in the &kword; file. </para>
<para>Once you are satisfied with the size and position of the selection box, click <guibutton>Final Scan</guibutton>.  The scanner will scan the selected area at the resolution you selected.  </para>
<para>When the scanner is finished, click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to close the dialog box.  Your cursor will now be crosshairs.  Using this cursor, draw the size and position you want your picture on the

<para>The checkbox labeled <guilabel>Ask for the scan device on plugin startup</guilabel> toggles the scanner selection dialog on and off.  If there is a mark in this 
checkbox, &kword; will ask you to select your scanner each time you insert a scanned image into your document.  If there is no mark, then &kword; uses the previously 
selected scanner.  If you have access to only one scanner, or you only use one scanner, you should remove any mark from this box.</para>
<para>The checkbox labeled <guilabel>Query the network for scan devices</guilabel> is also used to select scanners.  If there is a mark in this checkbox, 
&kword; will check your local network for scanners that are available.  If there is no mark in this box, &kword; will only look for scanners connected directly to 
your machine.</para>
