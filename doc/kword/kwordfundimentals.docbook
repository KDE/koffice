<para>This next section is designed to show you how to start
<application>KWord</application> and some basic but important concepts
you should understand when using KW</para>

<title>Starting Kword</title>

<para>
KWord can be started one of four ways:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>You can select Kword through the system menus, under:  <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>K-Button</guimenu><guimenuitem>Office</guimenuitem>
  <guimenuitem>KWord</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.</para> </listitem>
<listitem><para>If you are in a terminal program (KVT, Xterm, etc), you can type:
<screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>kword &amp;</command></screen></para>
<para>Or</para>
<para><screen><prompt>$</prompt> <command>kword <replaceable>filename</replaceable> &amp;</command></screen></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Using <application>Konqerer</application>, you can click on your data file (KWord documents end in .kwd).  This will automatically start <application>KWord</application> and begin editing the file.</para></listitem>

<title>An Introduction to Templates</title>

<para>OK, so the first question you may have is:</para>

<para><emphasis>Why do I need to use a frames based word processor, when
I am perfectly happy writing my letters on my current, Page Layout,
word processor? </emphasis></para>

<para>Well the good news is, adjusting to a frames based word processor
is easy and once you select a template, <application>KWord</application>
will act just like the Page Layout wordprocessor you are used to.
There are templates available for simple correspondance and day to day
use.</para>

<para>When you need to generate a more complex document (newsletters,
posters, etc), however, you will not need to switch to a different program
to generate these special documents. There are templates which will help
you generate your newsletters or other more complicated documents.</para>

<para>OK. So now that you are willing to give this a try, we should talk
briefly about what templates are, what templates can do for you and how
you work with templates.</para>

<para><emphasis>What are templates and what can they do for me</emphasis></para>

<para>A template can be thought of as an initial mold for your document.
When we sit down to write a document, we already have an idea of what the
final product will look like. If you are writing a letter to a business,
you want a document with only one column, which goes all the way accross
the page, and from top to bottom of the page.
When you sit down to author a newsletter for a local organization,
however, you may want a large title accross the top, and several columns
for quick news articles.</para>

<para>With &kword;, you can use this preplanned notion of how your
document should look and using a template, you can create a set of
frames to approximate this final layout. For your business letter,
you can select one large frame that covers the page from top to bottom
and side to side (excluding margins of course). For that newsletter,
however, you may decide that a two or three column document is more
to your liking. Once you select this template, KWord will create the
frames for you.</para>

<para><emphasis>What if I decide later to change my layout</emphasis></para>

<para>This is not a problem. If you begin your document as a single
column document and decide later that two columns is better for your
needs, you can add another column. The purpose of templates is not to
limit your ability to change your layout, but rather to take some of
the work load off you whenever possible.
Choosing the correct template when you begin your document will simplify
the formating (as opposed to always selecting the default template and
making your changes later.), but it is also important to remember that
choosing the wrong template will not limit your work.</para>

<para><emphasis>Working with frames (aka Your First Document)</emphasis></para>

<para>The following section, consists of two fundimental topics which
you should understand before we continue, followed by a step by step walk through
of the most important functions you will need to understand to complete
a complex document. We will generate the start of a newsletter using
this tutorial. If you do not want to complete the tutorial, or have
questions about a specific aspect of frames, you can use the following
to jump directly to that section of the tutorial:</para>

<para>This tutorial is designed to be done in order, starting with
<link linkend="WPVSDTP">The difference between Text Oriented and Page Layout
templates.</link> I recommend going through the tutorial in order at least once.</para>

<sect1 id="WPVSDTP"> 
<title>The difference between Text Oriented and Page Layout templates</title>
<para>Before we begin with the tutorial, it is important that the
difference between Text Oriented and Page Layout templates is clear in your
mind.</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry>
<term>Text Oriented</term>
<listitem><para>The Text Oriented templates are designed to act like
page-oriented wordprocessors. When you select a Text Oriented template, you
will create a template with one or more frames. The first frame is
distinctly tied to the paper size of your document. When you increase
or decrease the paper size or change the margins, the frame size is automatically adjusted.
You are <emphasis>not</emphasis> able to move this frame around on the
page and you cannot delete this frame. If you need to adjust the size
or position of this frame, you must <link linkend="PageFormat">adjust
the margins</link>. On top of the
first frame, you can, of course, add additional frames. These frames
can contain pictures, text or whatever you want. These new frames can
be moved, resized and deleted to suit your needs. If you want it, KWord
will even wrap the text from the first frame around any information in
any subsiquent frames.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
<varlistentry>
<term>Page Layout</term>
<listitem><para>These templates are designed for desktop publishing.
When you select a template from this class, all of the frames are
"created equal". This is where the difference between Page Layout and
Text Oriented template lies. None of the frames in a Page Layout template
are tied to the page as tightly as the main frame in a Text Oriented template
is. Each of the frames is independent of the page size, and can be moved
or resized without changing margins, etc. Of course this also means
that altering the margins or papersize of your document requires that
you individually move/resize each frame.
</para></listitem>
</varlistentry>
</variablelist>

<para>As you can see, the choice between Page Layout and Text Oriented templates
is a choice between flexibility (Page Layout) and convenince (Text Oriented).
You can create any document you like with either type of template.</para>

<para>If the concept of templates is still unclear, please follow along with
the following tutorial. The first document you create will use
a Page Layout template. This should help clairify exactly how templates
function.</para></sect1>

<sect1 id="TextandFrame">
<title>The difference between Text Edit mode and Frame Edit mode</title>

<para>Before we begin the tutorial, there is one other feature of
<application>KWord</application> we should cover.</para>

<para>If you think about it, most documents consist of two separate but
often interrelated components:
<orderedlist Numeration="Arabic">
<listitem><para>The content, which consists of text you enter through
the keyboard, the pictures you have on your hard disk, the data in your
spreadsheet, etc.  This is the subject of your document. This is the information you want to convey.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The layout, which consists of how the information is
given to the reader. Multiple columns, boxes surrounding text, italics
for emphasis, etc. Using good layout, you can organize and emphasize your information in a way that is easily understood by the reader.  </para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>

<para>This same division exists when using KWord.</para>

<para>KWord has two modes of operations:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Text Edit Mode</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Frame Edit Mode</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Text Edit Mode is most commonly used for the <emphasis>entry of
the content</emphasis> of the document. In Text Edit Mode, you enter
text from the keyboard, cut and paste from other applications, fill
tables with your data, etc.</para>
<para>Frame Edit Mode is most commonly used for the
<emphasis>layout</emphasis> of the document. Using Frame Edit Mode,
you can adjust the width of text, resize pictures, etc.</para>
<para>This is not to say that you will never enter content from Frame
Edit Mode, and never alter layout in the Text Edit Mode, but you will
find that most often the previous guides will serve you well.</para>
<para>You can enter Text Edit Mode using the menu by
selecting: <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit
Text</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, by pressing F4, or by clicking on the
Text Edit toolbar button
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="textmode.png" align="center"/></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>

<para>You can enter Frame Edit Mode using the menu by selecting:
<menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Edit
Frame</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, by pressing
F5, or by clicking on the Frame  Edit toolbar
button <inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="framemode.png"/></imageobject><textobject><phrase>Button</phrase></textobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>

<para>It is important to keep this distinction in mind when using &kword;. Depending on whether you are in Frame Edit Mode or Text Edit Mode, &kword; will act differently.</para>

<para>Now that we have discussed the differences between publishing and Text Oriented Documents and introduced the differences between Text Edit Mode and Frame Edit Mode, we will begin the tutorial</para>
