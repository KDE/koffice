<para>The <guilabel>Outline</guilabel> and
<guilabel>Preview</guilabel> panes give an overview of your entire
presentation.  The <guilabel>Preview</guilabel> pane provides
thumbnails of each slide, and allows you to drag and drop to change
the order.  The <guilabel>Outline</guilabel> pane provides a
hierarchal tree of each slide, and also the objects inside the slides.
As well as overview, this allows you to easily select objects which
may be covered by others, or are otherwise difficult to grab directly on
the slide.</para>
