<para>Things you might like but &kpresenter; does not yet do (and what
to do about it)</para>

<!--
 FIXME: Does video embedding via kmplayer or kaboodle work?

<para>Movies or video. You cannot run video within &kpresenter;. If
you really need to show a movie, make a link to it on your desktop,
move &kpresenter; out of the way, click the link to the movie file and
use <application>mplayer</application> (or similar) to view it.</para>
  -->

<para><application>Powerpoint</application> Files. &kpresenter; does
attempt to import &Microsoft; <application>Powerpoint</application>
files but it does not always work perfectly. It depends on the
<application>Powerpoint</application> file version and what is in the
file. You can always import pictures for the background image and
re-type any text. It's not the ideal solution, re-doing the entire
presentation. However, just bear in mind that
<application>Powerpoint</application> does not even attempt to read
&kpresenter; files.</para>

<para>Taking notes or minutes. One piece of software allows you to
make notes during the meeting and puts them into a word
processor. If you are speaking, someone else should be taking notes. If
you really must do this sort of thing, take a note pad and pencil.
