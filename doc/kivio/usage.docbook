<title>Basic Usage</title>

<sect1 id="starting">
<title>Starting &kivio;</title>
<para>Like other &koffice; applications on startup &kivio; presents a Create Document dialog. The three tabs offer a choice of creating a new document, opening a saved document or choosing a document from a list of recently saved files.</para>
<para>If you're new to &kivio; begin by creating an empty document by double-clicking on the <guilabel>Empty Document</guilabel> template.</para>
<para>&kivio;'s main window contains a view of the current document. The page outline and margins are shown, as is a grid. Surrounding this view are horizontal and vertical rules. By default a tools toolbar is placed on the left-hand side and beneath the document view is a page selector, beneath that the status bar which shows the current position of the mouse pointer as a location on the page.</para>
<para>At the top of the window are the two main toolbars. These contain buttons for the most commonly used features of &kivio;.</para>

<sect1 id="stencils">
<title>Using Stencils</title>
<para>Diagrams are created by placing different pre-drawn shapes called stencils on the page. Stencils can represent many different things and &kivio; comes with a wide selection. For ease of reference they grouped into collections known as stencil sets. To use a stencil set select <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add Stencil Set</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The stencil sets have been sub-divided into several groups, a sub-menu lists these. The shapes in the stencil set are shown on the left-hand side of the document view.</para>
<para>Stencils are grouped into stencil sets for organizational purposes only, it is perfectly okay to add several stencil sets to a document and &kivio; allows you to mix and match stencils from different sets freely.</para>
<para>To place a stencil onto the document simply drag it from the stencil area to the page.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Selecting Stencils</title>
<para>
&kivio; identifies the stencil currently being edited by displaying six green rectangles on the corners and edges of a square around the stencil. Stencils shown in this manner are described as being selected. The green rectangles are known as handles.
To change the currently selected stencil move the mouse pointer over the stencil you wish to select and press the &LMB;.
To select all the stencils in the current document select <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Select All</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
To deselect all stencils select <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Select None</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.
</para>
