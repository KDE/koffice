Welcome to the KWord 1.3 to OOWriter import filter


Note: the information in this file is meant for devlopers, not for end users.


Following are a few points about some particularities when developing this filter.


=== Old Libexport Code ===

Be careful when programming on code coming from the old KWord export filter
library (the files whose names start with KWEF.)

Due to how the code was created, there are 2 typical traps:
- uninitialized variables
- type error while casting

Unfortunately, also due to the design of the code the compiler cannot help much
to keep developers out of these traps, as it does not get enough information to
catch such errors.

=== Syntax Versions ===

KWord has a few syntax variants, starting with the 3 official syntax versions
(called 1, 2 and 3) but there is also KWord files predating syntax 1 and also
the files generated by KWord import filters might differ too.

There are 2 big syntax groups: the old syntax and the new one. The old syntax
is syntax 1 or older, the new syntax starts with syntax 2.

The aim of this filter is to support any file claimed to be a KWord file (as the
user has not chosen the version with which he has generated the file.)

So be careful when modifying code not to remove support for other syntaxes (be
it newer or older ones). This also means not to assume that a certain tag or
attribute always exists in a KWord tag. Only very few does so.
