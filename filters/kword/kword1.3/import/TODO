=== Raw Notes === (Raw ideas, may not apply to the problem)
- preview image: a point for each character (if there is no preview in the original document. But do we need such a preview?)
- the main frameset is not necessarily the first one (at least in recent files it seems.)
- middle term solution for debug.xml (transform it in a sort of test case?)
