1. Welcome

 Welcome to KWord's AbiWord import/export filter.

 For now, this file is just a storage for some technical notes.

2. AbiWord's Multiple File Formats

 AbiWord's file format has evolved with the time. The older file formats are
 XML-like, the newer ones are in XML.

 See the file FileFormats.html for an overview!

 The AbiWord filter for KWord *must* be able to read all those formats. A user
 will not be happy if you tell him that his sub-version is not supported!

 However to make it easier all these formats differ mainly only in the header.
 (Only the "awml" format has different names for some tags.)

 Additionally, some files ("anonymous" ones?) seems to have tags and attributes
 in upper case. This must also be taken care of.

 Files in all those formats can be found in the source distribution of AbiWord
 (www.abisource.com), see in AbiWord's source code under the sub-directory
 test/wp and under its own sub-directories.

3. A Few Problems

 AbiWord is still in development. Be careful that future file formats does not
 contain potential problems. At least they should not crash the import filter.

 You must really look into AbiWord's source code, as you will have the surprise
 to find that the documented file format (also in the source distribution) does
 not tell everything.
