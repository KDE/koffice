<h1>1 Foreword</h1>
<p>AbiWord's file format has evolved with the time. The older file formats are
XML-like, the newer ones are in XML.</p>

<p>The names given for each file format are <span class="bold">not</span>
official, it is just how I have named them.</p>

<p>They might be also other variations of the file format than those described below.</p>

<p>The CVS dates are the dates when I have tested and found out things. So any
feature described must have appeared earlier. The dates are in format year-month-day.</p>

<h1>2 AbiWord's File Formats</h1>

<p>Here are a few versions (from oldest to newest):</p>

<dt>awml</dt>
<dd>
The "awml" format starts with a tag <span class="tags">&lt;awml&gt;</span>
and has no other header before. Some tags have different names than in later
versions.
</dd>

<dt> Anonymous</dt>
<dd>
The "anonymous" format is the same but the tag
<span class="tags">&lt;awml&gt;</span> is now named
<span class="tags">&lt;abiword&gt;</span>. Some of these files have upper case
tag and attribute names.
</dd>

<dt>Numbered</dt>
<dd>
The "numbered" version has a special header embeded in XML comments and the
tag <span class="tags">&lt;abiword&gt;</span> has now a
<span class="attribute">version</span> attribute with a version number as
parameter.
</dd>

<dt>Unnumbered</dt>
<dd>
The "unnumbered" version has the version number of the
<span class="attribute">version</span> attribute with the value "unnumbered".
</dd>

<dt>XML</dt>
<dd>
The "xml" version has a XML declaration (
<span class="tags">&lt;?xml</span> ) and but has still the special header after
the XML declaration. Note: the encoding (e.g. UTF-8) is not always given.
</dd>

<dt>File Format 1.0</dt>
<dd>
The "fileformat 1.0" version: the <span class="tags">&lt;abiword&gt;</span>
tag has an attribute <span class="attribute">fileformat</span> (set to 1.0)
</dd>

<dt>Wrong Doc Type</dt>
<dd>
The "wrong doctype": a DOCTYPE was added with a wrong public type of:
<span class="doctype">"-//W3C//DTD ABW 1.0 Strict//EN"</span>.
(Wrong is the W3C part! W3C has nothing to do with AbiWord. AbiWord Bug #1882)
</dd>

<dt>Correct Doc Type</dt>
<dd>
The "correct doctype": (AbiWord CVS 2001-08-21) with a DOCTYPE of:
<span class="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE abw PUBLIC
"-//ABISOURCE//DTD ABW 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.abisource.com/awml.dtd"&gt;
</span>
</dd>

<dt>New Doc Type / Wrong Name Space Definition</dt>
<dd>
The "new doctype": (AbiWord CVS 2002-02-??) with a DOCTYPE of:
<span class="doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE abiword PUBLIC
"-//ABISOURCE//DTD AWML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.abisource.com/awml.dtd"&gt;
</span>
The name space definition is wrong because it uses <span class="attribute">xmlns:awml</span>.
However it is the default name space of the file so it should be defined by
<span class="attribute">xmlns</span>. The <span class="tags">&lt;abiword&gt;</span>
tag has new attributes: <span class="attribute">version</span> and
<span class="attribute">styles</span>.
</dd>
