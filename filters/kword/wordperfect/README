Import filters for WordPerfect

Hello All,

I would like to mention, that Jaroslav Fojtik's WP2LaTeX
is really great tool which understands most
of fuzziness of the WordPerfect. We have used it to convert
AmiPro/WordPro documentes to Latex at university.
We have exported documents as WordPerfect 6 format
in WordPro. Result documents are not correct 
enough that leads even to WordPerfect to crash.
But WP2LaTeX has been able to convert them
into usable Latex code, including images converted from
WPG to EPS and equations.

It could be very helpful to use some pieces and knowledge
from WP2LaTeX for Koffice WordPerfect import filter.
