2009-03-05  Benjamin Cail <cricketc@gmail.com>

2009-02-16  Benjamin Cail <cricketc@gmail.com>

	* Released wv2-0.3.0 with basic for images, both metafile and
	  bitmap.

2006-06-12  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Applied security fix to HEAD

2004-09-14  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Applied a patch by Friedemann Kleint (Fa. metis) <kleint@bifab-l.de>
	  with fixes for Solaris / Sun C++ 5.5 Patch 113817-02 2003/08/29.
	  Additionally fixes some tab-related bugs (unique and erase stuff)

2004-05-10  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Ported the gcc 3.4 fixes to HEAD

2004-05-09  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Released wv2-0.2.2 (WV2_0_2_1_BRANCH)

	* Fixed compilation with gcc 3.4

2003-11-08  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Cleaned up the configure.in script and the Makefiles a bit.
	  Let's hope this still works everywhere and doesn't barf on the
	  iconv test on Cygwin...

2003-11-06  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Safer version of the wvlog.h fix. Backported to the branch.

	* Added a version header surprisingly similar to kdeversion.h to
	  make it easier for the KOffice part of the filter.

2003-11-05  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Released wv2-0.2.1

	* Fixed a very stupid bug: it didn't compile on gcc 2.95.x ... doh!

	* Bumped the CVS version 0.2.5 and the library version to 2.0.0.
	  The goal is to have at least basic image support for the 0.3
	  release. Depending on the quality of the 0.2 release there might
	  be one or more bugfix releases (0.2.1, 0.2.2,...).

	* Released wv2-0.2

	* Merged some fixes from HEAD to the WV2_0_1_9_BRANCH

2003-10-23  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Fixed a tricky list bug. When a compat list was converted to Word 8
	  format it worked for the first time. From the second time on the
	  index into the pllfo was off-by-one. This triggered a crash in case
	  the first list in the pllfo was a compat one (i.e. there are *just*
	  compat lists in a document).

2003-09-11  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* More image stuff. I had to split some interfaces, let's see if it's
	  cleaner that way.

2003-09-08  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Started to implement image support for Word 6 style inline images.

2003-09-01  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Released wv2-0.1.9

2003-08-30  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Implemented a different logging mechanism to support a really
	  quiet wv2 for users. :-)
	  Packagers will have to use --disable-debug

2003-08-29  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Okay, as it turned out there was still a problem with lists and
	  restarting counters yesterday. Now all my test documents work
	  as expected, though.

2003-08-28  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Fixed the handling of startAt in list level overrides and
	  some related list bugs. Looks pretty okay now...

2003-08-26  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Fixed list handling for Word 6 files.

2003-08-25  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Added a public domain implementation of CRC32 written by
	  Ross Williams. We need that to calculate unique list ids.

2003-08-23  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Added some ideas about image handling in wv2 to the design document.
	  Moved some variables in Parser9x to the private section.

2003-08-13  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Fixed the problem of lost text in some Word 95 documents.
	  Unfortunately MS uses CP1252 characters marked as UNDEFINED
	  in the specification. iconv doesn't really like that.
	  The filter now tries to recover as much text as possible.

2003-08-09  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Rewrote parts of the design document to reflect the recent changes.

2003-08-07  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Removed the "any later version" clause from the license headers.

	* Released wv2-0.1.8

	* Fixed a bug in the lid handling

2003-08-01  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Fixed some SPRMs (Word 6 vs. Word 8)

2003-07-31  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Released wv2-0.1.7

	* Word 6/7 support should work now. Well, at least none of the test
	  documents crashes and headers/footers also seem to work. Now I'd
	  need some more test documents (including screenshots).

2003-07-23  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Started to implement Word 6/7 support by moving code around. This
	  stuff is quite tricky. Basically I'm trying to unify the code and
	  move it to the common base class Parser9x, which Parser95 and
	  Parser97 inherit.

2003-06-08  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Applied a patch from Ben Burton <bab@debian.org> to make wv2 work
	  with libgsf-1.8.x and libgsf-1.7.2.

	* Released wv2-0.1

2003-04-26  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Got rid of the acconfig.h file, as autoconf 2.57 issued warnings.

2003-04-08  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Applied a patch from Adrian Schroeter <adrian@suse.de>, fixing the
	  build system. (e.g. CFLAGS -> AM_CFLAGS,...)

	* Fixed the libtool versioning

	* Released wv2-0.0.9

2003-03-21  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Worked around another bug in list handling (05_...). Unfortunately
	  I have no idea how to fix that "the right way" as some information
	  is just missing and I see no way to recover it (having only one
	  test document with that oddity). Maybe I can recognize a pattern
	  when I get some more flaky list documents.

	* Fixed a bug in list handling, avoids crashes on flaky documents.

2003-03-16  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Removed the "/wv2" after the include path, to avoid header
	  clashes when #including e.g. parser.h (libxml2 also has a
	  header named parser.h)

2003-03-09  Werner Trobin  <trobin@kde.org>

	* Released wv2-0.0.8 (and decided to start writing a ChangeLog :-)

	* Registered the project at freshmeat.net
