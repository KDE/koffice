This file contains the next few features I'd like to implement (in no
particular order):

* SPRM related:
  - Try to implement some more of the known SPRMs and merge the information
    about the non-documented sprms from OOo
  - Try to find out what the sprms 0xD632 and 0xD634 mean and how to interpret
    them (OOo). Some spacing related thing. Check all other sprms found in
    C.U.5.doc. It seems that some previously undocumented sprms like 0xD620
    are known in OOo now.

* Image reading:
  - Try to write some image reading code, OOo has some nice comments in the
    ww8graf* files.
  - Find out how drawings are anchored, tell David
  - Try to import textboxes / header-textboxes. Note: Internally they are
    represented like drawings

* Performance:
  - Run cachegrind on the parsertest and check for bottlenecks

* Bugs:
  - The parser has problems with Informatikmanagement.doc (header)
  - The generated testcases have alignment problems on Solaris
  - The helpertest fails on Solaris with some backtrace ending in UString. Weird
  - Fields don't really work in the KOffice part of the filter... (e.g. page
    numbers in the footer)

* Build system:
  - Fix the iconv test (cygwin link line problem)
  - Make sure to create some test system with gcc 2.95.x...
