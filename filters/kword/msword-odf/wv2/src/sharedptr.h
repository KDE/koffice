 * counter keeping track of how many other objects have a reference to
 * their object.  If used with @ref SharedPtr, then your object will
 * not be deleted until all references to the object have been
 * released.
 *
 * You should probably not ever use any of the methods in this class
 * directly -- let the @ref SharedPtr take care of that.  Just derive
 * your class from Shared and forget about it.
