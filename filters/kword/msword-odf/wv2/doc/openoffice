This file holds a few hints about the OpenOffice (OOo) WinWord 8 filter, in
case you want to understand the Word file format and the HTML specification
is just too confusing.

First of all the most important part: The OOo filter is dual licensed, and
one of those licenses is the LGPL, so it's legal to look at their code (at
least for my understanding of the LGPL, please correct me if I'm wrong.)

You can find the OOo WinWord filter in: openofficedir/sw/source/filter/ww8

Now some hints where to find certain code inside the OOo filter:

1) The sprm handling code is spread across several files; it provides some more
   information than the SPEC, as the OOo crew reverse engineered some of the
   sprms:
     ww8par6.cxx, around line 4890 contains an array called aSprmReadTab, which
       relates the sprm codes to a function processing those sprms.
     ww8scan.cxx, around line 5650 contains an array called aWwSprmTab, which
       holds the sizes of the sprms. There's also some other sprm information
       in that file.
