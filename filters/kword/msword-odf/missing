This file lists the major things missing in the current implementation of the
consumer (consumer == this KWord filter, consuming the wv2 callbacks).

The full documentation for the structures named below can be found at:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wvware/wv2/src/generator/generator_wword8.htm
Always download the latest version, we try to fix bugs in the SPEC.
(Attention: this is a big file)

Missing (not in any particular order):
- The filter should read the STTBFASSOC (a bunch of strings containing the
  author, title, keywords,...) for documentinfo.xml
