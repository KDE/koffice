This file lists the major things missing in the current implementation of the
consumer (consumer == this KWord filter, consuming the wv2 callbacks).
I have no idea if it will be possible to keep that simple structure, or if it
will be necessary to switch to a more powerful design. Remember: right now
the filter is just hacked up to test wv2 a bit (and it has surprising
similarities to the ascii import filter).

The full documentation for the structures named below can be found at:
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/wvware/wv2/src/generator/generator_wword8.htm
Always download the latest version, we try to fix bugs in the SPEC.
(Attention: this is a big file)

Missing (not in any particular order):
- The filter should read the STTBFASSOC (a bunch of strings containing the
  author, title, keywords,...) for documentinfo.xml

If you have any problems implementing them or if you have suggestions for a
better wv2 API please contact Werner Trobin <trobin@kde.org>
