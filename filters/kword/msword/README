This filter is the new MS Word import filter, based on the wv2 library (an
independent project). To build it you have to:

1) Get recent wv2 sources via anonymous CVS access. Please check this page for
   details: http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=10501
   The module name is "wv2"
2) Install the library by invoking ./autogen.sh, configure, make, and
   make install (you might want to specify a --prefix when running configure)
   It's also recommended to use --disable-debug for a release version to avoid
   the excessive debug output of wv2.
   If you want to check whether wv2 has been built successfully, you should
   "make check" wv2 and run the tests in wv2/tests. They print a lot of debug
   information, but as long as the exit code is 0 it worked.
   Please report any problems with building wv2 to trobin@kde.org.
3) (Re)Run make -f Makefile.cvs in the KOffice toplevel directory
4) (Re)Run configure with your usual configure options. If you specified some
   special --prefix for the wv2 library above, please add --with-libwv2=DIR
   to your configure options.
   The configure script should detect wv2, to verify that you should grep
   config.h in the toplevel KOffice directory for "WV2".
5) Build and install koffice/filters/kword/msword. If the build fails please
   first try to update wv2 and the msword directory. If you're are using a CVS
   version of wv2 (i.e. not a released version but current CVS HEAD) please
   take a look at Makefile.am, you might have to uncomment some compile flags.
   In case that doesn't fix your problem please send a bug report to
   koffice@kde.org (you don't have to be subscribed to post there).
6) Ensure that the file $KDEDIR/share/services/ole_winword97_import.desktop
   doesn't exist on your system. If you installed all of KOffice HEAD it should
   be gone already.

Use it like any other KOffice filter.
