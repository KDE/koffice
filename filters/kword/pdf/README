This importer is more or less a wrapper around Xpdf code (see "xpdf"
directory for details).


Usage: once installed in the correct KDE directories, kword will be
able to open PDF files transparently by using this module.


Requirements: You need the following libraries and headers (found usually
in the "devel" packages of distributions):

- Qt >= 3.0
- KDE >= 3.0
- KOffice >= 1.2
