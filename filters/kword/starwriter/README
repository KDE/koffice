StarWriter 5.x Import Filter
by Marco Zanon <info@marcozanon.com>

This stuff is still under development, will probably crash a lot and
may not work properly.

The filter only imports StarWriter Document (SDW) version 5.  Older
version is not supported at the moment and might or might not be in
the future.  StarWriter 6 document uses XML format which should be
handled by OpenOffice Writer filter.

KOLE stuff (to read OLE storage) is written by Ariya Hidayat
(ariya@kde.org) and should be considered as experimental, not even in
alpha or beta quality.

Helps, patches, bug reports are all welcomed.
