StarWriter 5.x Import Filter
by Marco Zanon <info@marcozanon.com>

This filter is still under development, will probably sometimes crash
and may not work properly.
At the moment it only loads text, without attributes; support is going
to be added for tables (ready but still unstable), paragraphs and
characters attributes (to be written soon) and pictures.

NOTE. We need to know how to read page properties such as size and
margins (without using the 'J' section, which instead refers to
"File -> Printer setup" and not to "Format -> Page").

The filter only imports StarWriter Document (SDW) version 5. Older
version is not supported at the moment and might or might not be in
the future. StarWriter 6 document uses XML format which should be
handled by OpenOffice Writer filter.

POLE stuff (to read OLE storage) is written by Ariya Hidayat
<ariya@kde.org> and should be considered as experimental, not even in
alpha or beta quality.

Helps, patches, bug reports are all welcomed.
