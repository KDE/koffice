Lotus AmiPro File Format (NOT FINISHED YET)

1  Foreword
-----------
This is solely based on my reverse-engineering work whilst
I work on AmiPro import filter for KWord.

2  Structure of AmiPro document
-------------------------------
An AmiPro document consists of (in order of appearance):
- header
- content, i.e the text
- embedded objects (frame, image, ...)

3  Formatting
-------------
Basic text formatting, such as bold, italic, and so on is
done inline by enclosing the text in a form of tag (like
HTML tag). A tag is something like: <+$>

The following list summarizes known formmating tags:
  <+!> bold on
  <-!> bold off
  <+"> italic on
  <-"> italic off
  <+#> underline on
  <-#> underline off
  <+)> double underline on
  <-)> double underline off
  <+$> word underline on
  <-$> word underline off
  <+&> superscript on
  <-&> superscript off
  <+'> subscript on
  <-'> subscript off
  <+%> strikethrough on
  <-%> strikethrough off

Note: Word underline is just like underline, except that
spaces between words are not underlined.

4  Styles
---------
Styles are defined in the header. More about this will be
examined later.

Styles are applied using the following sequences:
@StyleName@, which put inline (within the text/content).

5  Frame, Image, Table
----------------------
still pretty much a mystery :-P
