/**
 *  This class implements a stack for the different styles of an object.
 *
 *  There can be several styles that are valid for one object. For example
 *  a textobject on a page has styles 'pr3' and 'P7' and a paragraph in
 *  that textobject has styles 'P1' and 'T3'. And some styles even have
 *  parent-styles...
 *
 *  If you want to know if there is, for example,  the attribute 'fo:font-family'
 *  for this paragraph, you have to look into style 'T3', 'P1', 'P7' and 'pr3'.
 *  When you find this attribute in one style you have to stop processing the list
 *  and take the found attribute for this object.
 *
 *  This is what this class does. You can push styles on the stack while walking
 *  through the xml-tree to your object and then ask the stack if any of the styles
 *  provides a certain attribute. The stack will search from top to bottom, i.e.
 *  in our example from 'T3' to 'pr3' and return the first occurrence of the wanted
 *  attribute.
 *
 *  So this is some sort of inheritance where the styles on top of the stack overwrite
 *  the same attribute of a lower style on the stack.
