libqpro library
===============

Purpose
-------
This C++ library provides functionality for reading and (eventually) writing
Quattro Pro spreadsheet files.

The library is designed as a tool for developers and does not provide any
(useful) programs itself.

The library was originally designed and written for the KSpread KDE
spreadsheet program as part of the Quattro Pro filter.  I have tried to write
it as a reusable set of classes so that it may used by other people,
particularly those writing spreadsheet filters.

KOffice programs rely heavily on the QT set of classes.  A QT interface to
the library provides a lot of advantages.  However I realise that not everyone
wants to include QT in their code and so the package produces either one or
two libraries.  If QT is installed on the build machine then both libraries
are built, otherwise only the non-QT library is produced.

Installation
------------
To compile and install enter the usual:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
