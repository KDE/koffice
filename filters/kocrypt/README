This code isn't quite done yet.  Translators, please don't do any work on
the desktop files unless you don't mind changing it all in the near future.

Also, the pure crypto code will eventually be abstracted to a library in
kdelibs.  Please don't change it's structure without contacting:

George Staikos <staikos@kde.org>
