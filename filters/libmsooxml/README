References to the ECMA-376 specification in the source code are made
by page number or chapter number. Page numbers are the physical PDF
document's page numbers as displayed by the viewer.

The proper version of the specification document is "ECMA-376 2nd edition
Part 1" (December 2008) [1]. It may not reflect the behaviour of MS Office
2007 but is of slightly higher quality than the 1st edition.
