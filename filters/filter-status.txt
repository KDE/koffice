= KOffice filters and State =

The KOffice file import and export filters are ''not'' in a good state. This document tries to make an inventory of all our filters, whether they are still useful and worth maintaining and whether they crash when used in KOffice 2.0.

Note: for testing the filters there exists svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/tests/kofficetests/ repository with test documents, some of which are no longer supported and an abortive attempt at creating an automated test application

Note: pole (p-ole) by Ariya has four copies: in the hancomword, starwriter, excel and powerpoint filters.
