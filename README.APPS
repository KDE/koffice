This directory contains the source code for the upcoming KOffice 1.6.
The 1.6 release is a kind of "in-between" release, and not program
will be actively developed here.  The real development will happen in
trunk, and will eventually lead to KOffice version 2.0, which will be
based on Qt4 and kdelibs4.

The maintainers of some programs have announced that they think that
the release cycle for 2.0 is too long and want a feature release in
between 1.5 and 2.0.  For all the rest of the programs, bugfixes that
are committed in the 1.5 branch will be forward ported to 1.6 at the
time of the release. 

Here is the list of applications that will be developed in the 1.6
cycle:

- kchart
- kexi
- krita
- kdgantt

It is up to the maintainer of those applications to merge their change with
trunk, and with 1.5 for fixed bugs.  For all the rest of the
applications / subdirectories, all changes for 1.5 will be forward
ported as described above.
