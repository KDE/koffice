------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Show stopper bugs
  + If there are several chartshapes, then the tool doesn't adapt	JOSI
    when one shape is chosen and then another.

* Smaller bugs
  + When you double click on a chart, the tool option window adapts
    to the data in the chart (e.g. the type, etc), but if the chart
    is selected by the default tool and then the chart tool is 
    activated, then this is not the case.  Note that if either the 
    legend or plot area is selected by the default tool instead of 
    the chart shape itself, it works again.
