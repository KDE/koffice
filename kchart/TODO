Before release of KOffice 1.6.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix bug 128758: misinterpretation of the checkbox "first row as label":

Think about doing it in one of these ways:

1 Change storage from a table for the data and QStringLists for the
  headers to storing everything in the table.  The first row and
  column will always be used for headers, and if they are empty, then
  either KDChart will have to autogenerate tables or we will provide
  empty ones (not decided yet).

  + Remove m_rowLabels and m_colLabels and make them locals in
    paintContent() (static?).
  + Rewrite painting to take this into account.
    - The translation code for the matrix can be taken from doSetData().
  + Remove doSetData, since it isn't necessary any more.
    - Check what LegendAutomatic does first, though.
  + Fix it so that when loading and saving, (old, standard, OASIS), 
    this will work.

2 Change paintContent() so that it takes into account if the data is
  external and that the first row or column contains or not contains
  headers.  This means that it will perhaps have to skip the first row
  or column when displayData is generated.

I Chose number 2.

================================================================
			     Towards 2.0
================================================================


Large items
-----------

* Separate Model / View
  We should create a new model that contains all of the document
  and let the embedded KDChart component become a viewer instead
  of a combined viewer and data storage.

  Some parts of the KDChart data structures could be reused, e.g. 
  the Data Storage (KDChartData).  This model must be able to 
  redraw itself, just like the present KoDocument can.

  + Make all the data be contained in the Model, so far being
    the part.

* Create a Flake shape of KChart

* Integrate KDChart 2.0

* Scripting
  + Kross support
  + DBUS for data manipulation					      2 ----
    - class KChartData
  + DBUS for chart manipulation					      2 ----
