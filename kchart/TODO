Large items
-----------

* Separate Model / View
  We should create a new model that contains all of the document
  and let the embedded KDChart component become a viewer instead
  of a combined viewer and data storage.

  Some parts of the KDChart data structures could be reused, e.g. 
  the Data Storage (KDChartData).  This model must be able to 
  redraw itself, just like the present KoDocument can.

  + Make all the data be contained in the Model, so far being
    the part.

* Create a Flake shape of KChart

* Integrate KDChart 2.0
