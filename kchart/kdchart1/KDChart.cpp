  \class KDChart KDChart.h

  \brief Provides a single entry-point to the charting engine for
  applications that wish to provide their own QPainter.

  It is not useful to instantiate this class as it contains
  static methods only.

  \note If for some reason you are NOT using the
  KDChartWidget class but calling the painting methods of KDChart directly,
  you probably will also use the KDChartDataRegionList class:
  This class is derived from QPtrList, so all of the Qt documentation
  for this class is valid for KDChartDataRegionList too, e.g. freeing
  of the pointers stored can either be done automatically or
  manually - so PLEASE take the time to read the reference information for this class!
