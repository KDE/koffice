This method of creating reports is temporary.
In the future kudesigner must be integrated with kplato
or maybe we'll use a totally different report generator.

Report templates use the same format as kudesigner
and can be read/created (partially) with it.

To map template fields to kplato data the following deviations exists:
1)  A <KPlato> tag to define where to select data from. Ex:
    <KPlato>
        <Detail Level="0"  SelectFrom="resourcegroups" />
        <Detail Level="1"  SelectFrom="resources" />
    </KPlato>
    will select properties from ResourceGroup into fields defined
    in Detail level 0, and properties from Resource into fields defined
    in Detail level 1.
2)
    When you define a Field, the Field attribute (called Name in kudesigner ui)
    is used to select the property from the kplato class.
    Ex:
        <Field Field="normalrate" />
3)
    You can also get data into fields by specifying <class>.<property>.
    Ex:
        <Field Field="project.name" />

4)
    Currently one "global" property exists: currentdate.
    So you can specify
        <Field Field="currentdate" />
    to present a localized formatted date.
    
The method I've used to create reports:
1)  
    Define the layout using kudesigner.
2)
    Save as flat xml file. This gives you a *.kut file.
3)  
    Use text editor to add the <KPlato> tag.
4)  
    Save as a *.ktf file.
