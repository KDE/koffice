<!--	A KPlato document consists of a projects, relations and
	resources. TODO: It should probably also remember settings
	for stuff like printing etc.

	A node in a project can be a project, task, milestone or terminalnode.
	Each node is given a unique identifier.
	A relation is a time restraint on the correlation between two
	nodes. These are identified by their identifier.
	A resource is one of the resources available and needed for the
	project. These could be persons, hardware, money etc.
