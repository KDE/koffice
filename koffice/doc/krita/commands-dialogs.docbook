<para>
You can create a selection based on the color values of pixels here. In the
dropdown box, choose which color range you want to select. Pixels will be
selected according to their color value on this scale (&eg; a fully yellow
pixel would score maximally on the yellow scale and on the red and green scales).
If you check the <guilabel>Invert</guilabel> box, the selection becomes inverted:
pixels will be more selected if they have a lower value in the specified range.
You can choose if the current selection should be
added to or subtracted from the color range selection by clicking the
respective option: <guilabel>Add to current selection</guilabel> or
<guilabel>Subtract from current selection</guilabel>. Choose
<guibutton>Select</guibutton> to actually perform the selection or
<guibutton>Deselect</guibutton> to remove these pixels from the selection.

<para>
This dialog allows you to convert your image from one color space to another.
The <guilabel>Target color space</guilabel> and <guilabel>Destination ICM
profile</guilabel> are used to set to which colorspace and profile the image
will be converted. You can influence how this conversion is done with the
<guilabel>Rendering Intent</guilabel> option.
</para>
<para>
With <guilabel>Perceptual</guilabel> conversion, the source color space is
mapped linearly to the destination color space. If the destination color space
<quote>accepts</quote> a lesser color range than the source, shifts may occur
because the range is compressed. <guilabel>Relative colorimetric</guilabel>
conversion converts every color to the closest color in the destination color
space. This may mean that a certain color range is mapped to one color in the
destination color space. <guilabel>Saturation</guilabel> means that fully
saturated colors will remain fully saturated, even if this means that the
actual color is changed. With <guilabel>Absolute colorimetric</guilabel>
conversion, the same approach is used as with <guilabel>Relative
colorimetric</guilabel>, but the white point of the color space (the value
designating the color white) is not changed to match the new color space,
which may result in unwanted changes to near colors.

In this dialog you can change a couple of image properties. First of all, the
<guilabel>Name</guilabel> of the image. If you did not set a name earlier
(that can also be done when creating the image), it will have a default name
like <quote>Image1</quote>. Then, you can set its size (determined by the
<guilabel>Width</guilabel> and <guilabel>Height</guilabel> in pixels and
the <guilabel>Resolution</guilabel> in dots per inch) and the color profile to
be used (<guilabel>Profile</guilabel>). Finally, you can fill in the

This dialog lets you resize your image. In the top part, you can choose the
way the image is resized. If you choose <guilabel>Resize</guilabel>, the size
of the image is changed, but its layers (which contain the actual contents)
will not be modified. So, when you double the height and width of the image,
your original image will occupy the top-left quarter part of your new image.
On decreasing the size of your image, the image layers will stretch out over
the image borders, unless you choose <guilabel>Crop layers on image
resize</guilabel>, which will crop all layers to the new image size.
</para><para>
With <guilabel>Scale</guilabel>, the image layers will be resized with the
image. So increasing the image size will actually enlarge the contents, and
similar for decreasing.
</para><para>
Under <guilabel>Pixel dimensions</guilabel>, you can set which new size you
want the image to have. The original size is given as a reference. The new
size can be set both as pixels or as a percentage, with 100% being the
original size. If you select <guilabel>Constrain proportions</guilabel>, the
new width and height will always be set to the same percentage. For example,
if you have an image of 200 x 100 pixels, and set the width to 20 pixels, the
height will automatically be changed to 10. With this checkbox unselected, you
can also resize the image non-proportionally. 
</para><para>
The <guilabel>Filter:</guilabel> dropdown box can be used to select a
different algorithm for determining the colors of the pixels in the newly
resized image that did not correspond to a pixel in the old image (the
calculated corresponding location in the old image was located in between
pixels). BSpline uses a 4 x 4 pixel grid and results into a quite high
blurring. Bell is quite fast while resulting in a reasonably smooth image.
Box is the fastest method, but yields the least appealing result. Hermite
keeps the image quite sharp, while smoothing it as well, and is reasonably
fast. Lanczos3 results in sharp images, but is very slow.  Mitchell (the
default) is not very fast, but often yields a good intermediate result.
Triangle/Bilinear uses the 2 x 2 pixel grid around the calculated location,
resulting in relatively sharp lines.

With this dialog, you can separate (part of) your image. Every color component
(channel) will be put into a separate layer or image. At the top of the
dialog, the current color model is shown. Below that, a couple of options can
be set.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Source</guilabel>, you can choose what part of the image to
separate. The two options are <guilabel>Current layer</guilabel>, which
(obviously) only uses the currently selected layer and <guilabel>Flatten all
layers before separation</guilabel>, which uses the entire image.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Output</guilabel>, you can choose where the result of the
separation should be written to: either to a couple of layers, or to a couple
of images.
</para>
<para>
Under <guilabel>Alpha Options</guilabel>, you can choose what should be done
with the alpha channel of the selected layer(s). It can be copied to each new
channel, be discarded, or separated on its own.
</para>
<para>
The two options at the bottom of the dialog, finally, determine whether the
source should be downscaled to 8 bit colors (if it contains more), and whether
the output should be in color (default is to separate the channels to grayscale
values).

blurred (to achieve a smooth transition at the shadow border). If you want
a special color for the shadow, you can choose one with the
<guilabel>Color</guilabel> field. The <guilabel>Opacity</guilabel> slider and

The curve diagram has a histogram-like background that shows you the abundance
of various brightness levels. The curve itself (initially a diagonal line from
bottom left to top right) determines to which new brightness level (on the
vertical axis) pixels with a certain original level (on the horizontal axis) are
to be mapped. For example, the default diagonal line from bottom left to top
right sets every original pixel to its own brightness value, meaning no
change. A horizontal line means that all pixels will get the same brightness.
This means minimal contrast, the brightness itself is indicated by the height
at which the line is placed.
</para><para>
You can click on a handle (red circle) to select it (a selected handle is
indicated by a filled circle) and drag it around to change the shape of the
curve. The curve will be drawn smoothly through the handles (always
strictly from left to right). If you click on the curve, a handle is added to
it at that position. Clicking somewhere else in the image will also add a
handle at that point. You can press <keycap>Delete</keycap> to delete the

You can apply a bumpmap effect and customize it using this dialog. One layer
is used as bumpmap layer: it is read as grayscale image and the gray values of
its pixels are used to to distort the other layer for creating the depth
illusion. High grey values, &ie; more white, mean a larger height, small
values, &ie; near black, mean a smaller height &mdash; or a larger depth, the
height can get <quote>below sealevel</quote>. A light source, shining
<quote>from above</quote> on the image that lies <quote>on the ground</quote>,
is simulated to determine the depth and direction of the shadows.

</para><para>
Under <guilabel>Type</guilabel>, you can select what kind of bumpmap to be

extremes, that is, the shadow and highlight values) and
<guilabel>Sinusoidal</guilabel> (focusing on the midtone values).
</para><para>
Then, there are three options to modify the bumpmap apart from its
algorithmical application. With <guilabel>Compensate for darkening</guilabel>,
the image is restored to about its original average lightness if using the
bumpmap filter would make it darker. The <guilabel>Invert bumpmap</guilabel>
option creates an inverted bumpmap (high and low are reversed). With
<guilabel>Tile bumpmap</guilabel>, a bumpmap layer that is smaller than the
layer it is applied to, will be tiled (repeatedly) to cover the entire layer.
</para><para>
Under <guilabel>Settings</guilabel>, you can select the mathematical
parameters for the bumpmap. First of all, <guilabel>Azimuth</guilabel> (the
angle of the light source in the X-Y plane), <guilabel>Elevation</guilabel>
(the height of the simulated light source above the surface in degrees, with 0
degrees being on the ground and 90 degrees being vertically above the image),
and <guilabel>Depth</guilabel> (the maximal vertical distortion of the image).
</para><para>
Then, there are the <guilabel>X offset</guilabel> and <guilabel>Y
offset</guilabel>, with which you can displace the bumpmap layer relative to
the destination layer, <guilabel>Water level</guilabel> (the depth seen as
neutral), and <guilabel>Ambient light</guilabel>, which determines the
relative amount of ambient (environmental) light.

The nine spinboxes at the top left determine the distortion. Each pixel is
assigned a new value based on these values: the old color values of the pixel
inself and the eight surrounding pixels are each multiplied by the values in
the respective spinboxes, these results are added, and the final result is the
new color value for the pixel. Before being applied, this final result can be
multiplied with a certain <guilabel>Factor:</guilabel> or a certain
<guilabel>Offset:</guilabel> can be added to it.
