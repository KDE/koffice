This chapter gives information on what colorspaces are, which colorspaces
&krita; offers, and what you should keep in mind when using them.

<title>What is a colorspace?</title>

<para>
In short, a colorspace is a way to represent colors by specifying a number of
parameters. As parameters, one can choose for example the amounts of red,
green and blue light needed for the color, which results in the commonly known
RGB colorspace. One can visualise this as a three-dimensional space, with each
of the red, green, and blue light components being an axis in the colorspace.
</para>
<note><para>
To be more precise, a colorspace is a combination of a color model (indicating
which axes are present) and a mapping function (indicating which values
correspond to which colors).
</para></note>
<para>
Not every color can be represented in every colorspace. Some colorspaces
define more, or different, colors than others. The set of colors that can be
represented in a certain colorspace is called its gamut. Because gamuts
can differ widely, it is not guaranteed that images in a certain colorspace
can be converted to another colorspace without having to substitute certain
colors for others, even if they are based on the same color model.

<sect1 id="colorspaces-list">
<title>Available colorspaces</title>

<para>
&krita; offers colorspaces based on the RGB, CMYK, Lab, LMS, and GRAY
color models. These are shortly discussed in this section.
</para>

<sect2 id="colorspaces-list-rgb">
<title>The RGB color models</title>

<para>
The abbreviation RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue, and the color model with
this name refers to the three light components that are emitted in displays
(televisions, computer monitors, etcetera) to create a certain color.
</para><para>
When defining a color in the RGB model, its red, green and blue components are
specified. If all components are absent (each component is emitted at 0
percent intensity, so no light at all), the color is pure black.  If all
components are fully present (100 percent intensity), the color is pure white.
If one component is present at full intensity and the other two are absent,
the pure respective color is obtained.
</para><para>
Two more examples: if both red and green are emitted at 100 percent and blue
is not emitted, pure yellow is obtained. A color with all three components at
the same intensity is a shade of gray.
</para><para>
There are various colorspaces that implement the RGB model. For example, the
so-called RGB8 colorspace represents each color with 8 bits per component.
Since 8 bits allow for 256 distinct values, the total number of different
colors that can be specified in this colorspace is 256 * 256 * 256, or about
16.7 million colors. In &krita;, a couple of RGB colorspaces are available,
for example RGB32, which is able to distinguish between 4.2 billion values per
component.

<sect2 id="colorspaces-list-cmyk">
<title>The CMYK color model</title>

<para>
CMYK is the abbreviation for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, blacK (although officially
the K stands for Key, black is much more commonly used). This color model is
based on ink: a color is specified by the amount of ink needed for a point
to be perceived as having that color.
</para><para>
Since CMYK colors are used by printers while RGB colors are used on-screen,
one wants to convert RGB colors to CMYK colors. As this cannot always be done
correctly, printed images may turn out to look quite different.
</para>

<sect2 id="colorspaces-list-lab">
<title>The Lab color model</title>

<para>
This color model uses the three parameters luminance (L, 0 for black and
100 for white), its position between red and green (a, negative for
green and positive for red), and its position between yellow and blue (b,
negative for blue and positive for yellow).
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="colorspaces-list-LMS">
<title>The LMS color model</title>

<para>
This model is based on the contribution of actual wavelengths to the color. L,
M and S stand for Long, Middle and Short wavelengths.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="colorspaces-list-GRAY">
<title>The GRAY color model</title>

<para>
The GRAY color model simply represents colors as shades of gray.
