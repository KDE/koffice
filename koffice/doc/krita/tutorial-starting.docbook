<title>Starting to know Krita</title>

<para>
So, let's show you all the niceties. You can start &krita; either on its own
or from the &koffice; shell. In your &kde; menus, &krita; should be placed
either under Graphics or under Office &mdash; it depends a bit on who packaged
&koffice; for you. Or do what I do: press
<keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> (which opens the
minicli), type <userinput><command>krita</command></userinput> and
press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.
</para>

<para>
A little later, you'll be greeted by a dialog:
</para>

<para>

<screeninfo>The Create Document dialog</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="createdocument.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>The Create Document dialog</phrase>
</textobject>
<caption><para>The Create Document dialog</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
This is standard for &koffice;: you can create a new document, choose a
document from among your files or select a document you had opened in an earlier
session. We have got a bunch of templates here, ordered by color model. &krita;
is a very flexible application and can handle many different types of images:
<acronym>CMYK</acronym> images for printers, <acronym>RGB</acronym> images for
the web, <acronym>RGB</acronym> images with high channel depths for
photographers, watercolor images for painters &mdash; and more. For now, choose
<guilabel>Custom Document</guilabel>. That will allow
us to see the New Image dialog box:

</para>

<para>
Here you can give your document a name, determine the dimensions and the
resolution. The combination of width/height and resolution determines how big
your image will be on screen or on paper: if your image has a resolution of
100x100 dpi, and your image is 1000x1000 pixels big, then, if everything is
configured correctly, your image will be exactly 10 inches long and 10 inches
wide if you check with a ruler, no matter the resolution of your screen or of
your printer &mdash; if shown at 100%. However, life is seldom so well-regulated
that this actually works out. For now, just think pixels, not inches.
</para>

<para>
The next group of options is a lot more interesting than resolution: &krita;
is an enormously flexible application and you can work with many kinds of
images. For this tutorial, just select <guilabel>RGB (8
bits/channel)</guilabel>. You can also select a profile. For now, we leave this
at the default setting of <guilabel>sRGB built-in - (lcms internal)</guilabel>.
</para>

<para>
In the third option group, you can select the initial canvas color and the
amount of opacity/transparency of this color. Furthermore you can
add a description of the contents. We leave these options at their default
settings as well, so click <guibutton>Create</guibutton> to actually create the new
image.
</para>

<para>
You will now see the main &krita; screen.
</para>

<para>
<screenshot>
<screeninfo>&krita;'s main screen</screeninfo>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="mainscreen.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
<textobject>
<phrase>&krita;'s main screen</phrase>
</textobject>
<caption><para>&krita;'s main screen</para></caption>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>
</para>

<para>
On the left hand side and on the top, there are toolbars which offer you access
to tools for painting, editing, and selecting.
You can find a more detailed description of these toolbars <link
linkend="commands-toolbars">here</link>. The actual painting area is in the
middle. On the right side of your screen, there are various palettes, which you
can read more about in <link linkend="commands-palettes">this section</link>.
Finally, there is a menu bar at the top of the screen, as usually. Read more
about it <link linkend="commands-menus">here</link>.
