Please use all-lowercase for new file names.
  The current mixed casing used in kofficecore and kofficeui is too confusing
  (koDocumentInfoDlg vs KoDocumentInfoDlg, the difference is hard to see),
  inconsistent with the rest of KDE, and breaks the emacs shortcut for auto-inserting
  #include statements.
  Maybe one day we'll rename all the current mixed-case files...
