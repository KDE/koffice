#define __KDCHARTBASESERIES_H__

// A single data series abstracted.
// Is included in a DataSeriesBag.
// Will be a base class for other series objects, such as DataVectorSeries,
// and DataQuerySeries.
//
// Requirements:
// - Able to handle its own parameters, colours, legend texts, etc.
// - Able to hide/show itself.
// - Almost completely abstract, so we can inherit it from other classes.
//   Implement things like hide and show here tho.
