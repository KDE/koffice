About Modules

Modules are plug-ins that implement exchangable core functionality
for Krita, such as colour strategies. Modules are loaded at startup
and shared among all Krita documents and views. That means that making
modules stateful is iffy, and that you need to be careful about 
re-entrancy.

Modules are named modules because the plugins, which are kpartgui's
are already called plugins. Capito? Good.
