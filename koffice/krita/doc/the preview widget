Agreed. We should show all of the image in our preview.

No, definitely not. In fact, if I remember correctly, preview copies & rend=
ers=20
the complete image. Options are:

* Just preview the active layer, out of context
* Copy the image, scale it down, and then render it. Cache the scaled-down=

thumbnail.
* Work on the QImage of the rendered image, and apply all filters on that -=
=2D=20
for preview, that may be accurate enough.

Note that we want a fast thumbnail preview for in the bird's eye box, too, =
and=20
in the variations dialog we need a whole bunch of previews. So I guess the=
=20
requirements are:

* Frugal with memory
* Fast
* Filters should work on the preview image
* Zoomable, but initially the complete image/layer is shown
* Selectable: preview layer/preview image

I have a feeling that this may be hard to achieve...
