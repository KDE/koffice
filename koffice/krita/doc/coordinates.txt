Coordinates in Krita

As with any paint app, finding out what you mean when you say (x,y) is difficult.
There are the screen coordinates, the coordinates of the canvas inside the view,
the zoomed coordinates -- and the image coordinates, paint device coordinates and the
coordinates of the data inside the paint device.

Iterators are created in terms of the image coordinates.
