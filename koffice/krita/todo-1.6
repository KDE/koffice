Colorspaces

R  * Fix drying the wet colorspace
R  * Fix fill in wet

Core

?  * Use the nextCol/nextRow of the line iterators wherever possible to get a speed boost.

User interface

?  * after hiding and reshowing all palettes, the wrong ones are active

Plugins

C  * finish, polish and document scripting support
P  * Select By Color -> Sample Merged
P  * Select plugins with sample merged -> default to sample merged when active layer is adj layer
P  * See if it could be interesting to make the color select tool update while dragging

Release

R  * develop thorough test plan and exercise it on several installations
     before release

Bugs

?  * Grow Selection doesn't seem to work on adj layers, investigate
?  * Select Rect/Circle -> doesn't erase the XOR'ed outline on the KisCanvas
?  * Selection Tools with Select All, Deselect and so don't play completely nicely with adj layers

Also: see UIcomments!

Michael's bugs:

* Open an image, add image as new layer, resize layer, undo: undo removes the layer
* open an image, add an adjustment layer to the image (I used the pixelize 
  filter). Click on the original layer in the layer dialog box and paint 
  something. The undo the painting and undo add layer. Krita's toolbox will 
  become greyed out and you can't paint. I think this is already a bug and 
  should be fixed. But next, try to add an adjustment layer again -> Krita 
  crashes.
* The shrink etc selection are enabled when there is no selection
* select by colorrange does not actually set the selection (or something like that)

Regressions

? saving 16 bit grayscale to jpeg silently converts to 8 bit grayscale (actually it's not a regression, saving to both 8bits and 16bits jpeg with the same build is impossible with libjpeg)
? zooming in leaves display artefacts (see Bart's mail)
? rotate is broken for large images
? rotate visitor is used where transform visitor should be used
? undoing a rotation when a selection is active leads to weird results

Painting with filters

? sharpen: works badly, paints circles -- this used to be okay!
? small tiles: makes circles, otherwise effect is fun

Note: make kivio flowchart of what happens when painting with and without filters,
with and without selection, direct or indirect, because I don't follow anymore
