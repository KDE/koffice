Krita is moving towards compatibility with the Gimp in the area of data
like patterns, brushes and gradients.  All brushes, patterns etc. here
are taken from the Gimp CVS.

This is the contents of the original authors file:

This distribution of gimp-data is based on Frederico Mena's
gimp-data-0.99.11, which was based on Matt Hawkins
gimp-data-0.99.pre11-3.5, which was based on gimp-data-0.99.9 by Spencer
Kimball and Peter Mattis.
