This library is still dependent upon krita/sdk for some headers. This
should be changed. The headers concerned are:

kis_id.h
kis_global.h
kis_annotation.h
kis_integer_maths.h

Additionally, there is a problem with the histogram producers: those are
tied to the individual base colorspaces, but also need iterators, so they
are in core for the moment.
