This is a GNUmeric import and export filter for kspread.

This is heavily based on the kspread CSV import and export filters.

It has been tested with Gnumeric v0.61 and kspread v1.0.

The file format is mainly based on reading output of gnumeric. It
requires the zlib library to read the compressed gnumeric output.

It does not change behavior based on the version of the gnumeric file.
This will have to be done in the future to maintain maximum compatibilit

I will have to go back with a fine tooth comb and implement 

Wouldn't it be nice to have a generic library used by all opensource
spreadsheets to import and export files.. Someday.

No idea if it is usefull; but it is a sin to let a good URL get lost...
