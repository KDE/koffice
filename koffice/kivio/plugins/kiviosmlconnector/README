DESIGN:
	This plugin will create a connector from a path created from a series of points.  At each point a handle will be placed, this includes connection points and control handles.

	Arrows are only available at the end points and only end points can connect to other shapes.

Example SML:
<KivioConnector>
	<Type data="Xor"/>
	<Points>
		<KivioPoint x="40" y="50" type="bezier"/>
		<KivioPoint x="30" y="40" type="bezier"/>
		<KivioPoint x="10" y="40" type="bezier"/>
		<KivioPoint x="0" y="50" type="bezier"/>
	</Points>
</KivioConnector
This will create an arc shaped connector with handles at the control points and handles at the end points
