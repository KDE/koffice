BUGS:
* freehand drawing tool with curve: sometimes the result disappears (seems to be caused by bezierFit receiving two points in sequence that are the same)
* when painting something at the side it becomes impossible to scroll to all areas of the screen
* when painting while the view is zoomed in very much in, the item may get somewere outside the visible area.
* ctrl+mouse weel zoom don't center correctly
* at times the cpu usage remains very high even without doing anything (shape proprieties seem to be the cause)
* colors used are not those of the global palette (I think)
* KoCreatePathTool.cpp:138 do the same in the pencil tool (use the forgroundcolor instread of hardcoded black)
* a "degenerate" curve doesn't show anything... (the same applies for points) (check how it will show in svg, and with inkscape, and using plain Qt paths)
* In a path without control points sometimes at one side there is still a piece of path when there shouldn't... (maybe a Qt bug if it uses QPainterPath so paint)
