Ideas from graphics meeting (but also in my head before it):

- use QPainterPath, get rid of libart
- use color profiles/matching (krita?)
- get rid of the old freetype code to convert text to path, use
  QPainterPath::addText instead.
- use koText for text boxes?
- improve printing, should be a lot better when we use QPainter(?)
- use real-time editing, for instance real-time changing of gradients
