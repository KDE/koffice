Karbon 0.0.0.1
==============

KIllustrator has some nasty design limitations and an awkward name ;).
Karbon will be a rewrite with some general and powerfull concepts in mind,
based on some years of experience with the big guys.
It will be a koffice-app, dont worry. The changes are so holoistic that it
very probable wont fit into KIllu without breaking it. But KIllu is fine and
working, but it's limited. So here we are.

This _not_ yet another vector app. It wont go away, since i need it myself.

Im finishing my degree right now, so karbon is in planing stage till
march/april. I will add the class design in some weeks, which is nearly
finished.
