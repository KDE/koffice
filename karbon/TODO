REAL BUGS:
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	dont always fill shapes especially when no fillShape() is called
-	select first/last segment's knot if one of each other's knot is selected
-	scale tool should only scale in one direction while dragging a slection node
-	if selecting many shapes, the fill/stroke state should be "unknown",
	preview widgets needs to paint questionmarks or something in this case
-	examine the problem with non closed paths (polygonize combined.karbon for example
	to make the inner circles rectangles)
	lenny: "i still dont see any vpainter:close() function are anything similar in vpath::draw().
	closed shapes' end where they started, but they are never closed. how could libart
	ever know it needs to paint a join here?"
-	use vflatten in vselectool for more precise selection (lenny)
	maybe use libart instead ("art_drect_svp from art_rect_svp")
-	compare ghostscript's "flatten" with our's (lenny)

TODO:
-	port path commands to vgroup::insertNewDeleteOld(), maybe add a vpathcommand
	similar to vshapecommand
-	add undo/redo to shape commands like VFlattenCmd etc
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	check/set winding in vpath::combine().
-	vroundcorners needs to be improved for beziers and big radii (lenny)
-	check in other apps if this makes sense:
	(make vselection a visitor and paint selected shapes instead of each shape)
-	scratch your head about how to do undo/redo of path operations best like
	removing nodes, inserting nodes...
-	allow for multiple strokes and fills in VPath. Also allow for strokes to be under
	fills for nice special effects.
-	Ctrl or Shift (pressed) while dragging a shape should make the shape move along only one axis

OPTIMIZATION:
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it
-	check places we use sqrt() if these are really necessary (lenny)

MAKE IT NICE:
-	pass all dialogs a parent
-	introduce centerOfMass() for vsegmentlist. problem: CM for beziers?
-	investigate whether we can use a KToolBar with an appropriate layout to replace
	our current non-conforming solution.
