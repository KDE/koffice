-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	rotate/scale/shear tool dont work
-	optimize boundingbox: cache in vsegmentlist (+ vsegment ?) and apply affine
	trafos (dont recalculate in that case) to them too
-	reintroduce whirl
-	why do we pass "VObjectList" to MCmds? We could use part->selection().
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
-	examine the problem with non closed paths (polygonize combined.karbon for example
	to make the inner circles rectangles)
-	implement gradients after libart code reorganisations (Rob)
-	really derive vtextcmd from vshapecmd?
