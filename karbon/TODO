REAL BUGS:
-	include lineWidth in vpath::boundingbox (tricky: trigger linewidth changes)
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	replace VObject::isInside() with a polygonizevisitor in vselectool (lenny)
-	rotate/scale/shear tool dont work
-	remove temporary solution for vpath::intersects()
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	examine the problem with non closed paths (polygonize combined.karbon for example
	to make the inner circles rectangles)
-	implement gradients after libart code reorganisations (Rob)

OPTIMIZATION:
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it

MAKE IT NICE:
-	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
-	pass all dialogs a parent
