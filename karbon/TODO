-	why do we pass "VObjectList" to MCmds? We could use part->selection().
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
-	polygonizing a sinus shapes results in a asymetric polyline
	(probably error in sinus generation).
