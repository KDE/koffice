1	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
2	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
3	reintroduce handler
4	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
5	polygonizing a sinus shapes results in a asymetric polyline
	(probably error in sinus generation).
