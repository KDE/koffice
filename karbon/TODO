REAL BUGS:
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	dont always fill shapes especially when no fillShape() is called
-	select first/last segment's knot if one of each other's knot is selected
-	if selecting many shapes, the fill/stroke state should be "unknown",
	preview widgets needs to paint questionmarks or something in this case
-	revert() in vpath::combine() doesnt work

TODO:
-	unify vselecttool and vselectnodestool

-	get tools right (unfiy this nasty code duplication)
-	scratch your head about how to do undo/redo of path operations best like
	removing nodes, inserting nodes...
-	port path commands to vgroup::insertNewDeleteOld(), maybe add a vpathcommand
	similar to vshapecommand
-	add undo/redo to shape commands like VFlattenCmd etc
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	vroundcorners needs to be improved for beziers and big radii (lenny)
-	allow for multiple strokes and fills in VPath. Also allow for strokes to be under
	fills for nice special effects.
-	use inside/intersection tests in vpath::combine() for changing winding.
-	use vflatten in vselectool for more precise selection (lenny)

WISHLIST:
-	Ctrl or Shift (pressed) while dragging a shape should make the shape move along only one axis

OPTIMIZATION:
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it
-	check places we use sqrt() if these are really necessary (lenny)

MAKE IT NICE:
-	pass all dialogs a parent
-	introduce centerOfMass() for vsegmentlist. problem: CM for beziers?
-	investigate whether we can use a KToolBar with an appropriate layout to replace
	our current non-conforming solution.
-	think about using ghostscript's flatten algo (see comments in vflatten.cc)
