-	make vselection a visitor
-	make vselection a pointer
-	move every selection into vselection
-	add a point-list to vselection

REAL BUGS:
-	linewith doesnt update bbox anymore
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	scale tool should only scale in one direction while dragging a slection node
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	examine the problem with non closed paths (polygonize combined.karbon for example
	to make the inner circles rectangles)
-	vroundcorners needs to be imrpoved for beziers and big radii (lenny)
-	introduce polygonizevisitor in vselectool for more precise selection (lenny)
-	move vdocument::moveSelection* to a proper command.
-	compare ghostscript's "flatten" with our's (lenny)

OPTIMIZATION:
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it
-	check places we use sqrt() if these are really necessary (lenny)

MAKE IT NICE:
-	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
-	pass all dialogs a parent
-	use (first introduce of course) centerOfMass() for vpath's
	"center knot" position. problem: CM for beziers?
