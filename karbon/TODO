TODO:
-	port path commands to vgroup::insertNewDeleteOld(), maybe add a vpathcommand
	similar to vshapecommand
-	check/set winding in vpath::combine().
-	vroundcorners needs to be imrpoved for beziers and big radii (lenny)
-	check in other apps if this makes sense:
	(make vselection a visitor and paint selected shapes instead of each shape)
-	scratch your head about how to do undo/redo of path operations best like
	removing nodes, inserting nodes...

REAL BUGS:
-	linewith adjustment via previewwidget doesnt update bbox
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	add undo/redo to shape commands like VFlattenCmd etc
-	scale tool should only scale in one direction while dragging a slection node
-	if selecting many shapes, the fill/stroke state should be "unknown",
	preview widgets needs to paint questionmarks or something in this case
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
-	examine the problem with non closed paths (polygonize combined.karbon for example
	to make the inner circles rectangles)
-	use vflatten in vselectool for more precise selection (lenny)
	maybe use libart instead ("art_drect_svp from art_rect_svp")
-	move vdocument::moveSelection* to a proper command.
-	compare ghostscript's "flatten" with our's (lenny)

OPTIMIZATION:
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it
-	check places we use sqrt() if these are really necessary (lenny)

MAKE IT NICE:
-	pass all dialogs a parent
-	introduce centerOfMass() for vsegmentlist. problem: CM for beziers?
