-	move "closed" from vpath to vsegmentlist
-	fix crash (something to do with static of current tool?)
	when loading or adding new view
-	fix tool-bar
-	reintroduce handler
-	fix selection
-	mirror coordinate-system so origin is bottom-left
-	add validators to all tool-dialog input-fields
-	painting (NotROP) while shape creation isnt good. creation should instead
	insert a temporary object (state "edit") right from the start.
	other vobjects shouldnt repaint if they didnt change put just blit their pixmap-cache.
