Work packages toward the koffice 2.0 release
---------------------------------------------------

Here are some main things we have to work on to get ready for koffice 2.0
Feel free to add or modify todos as they appear when working on karbon.
Before working on some of the following, just add your name beside the todo you want to work on so there
is no duplicate work.

Canvas:
-------
- the basic things for flake integration are there, we need to improve the existing code when working on the
  other parts
- we should improve the canvas so that we can center the canvas vertically too
- we should add/replace the canvas at the document docker (bird eye view)

KoPathShape:
------------

- make sure it supports all we had with the old karbon path
- some things that are currently lacking (taken from inkscape):
  - joining selected end nodes by merging them
  - nearest point on curve

Layers:
-------
- drag and drop of items to reparent or raising/lowering them

Shapes/Tools:
---------------
- check if the KoTextShape provided by KWord is flexible enough for our use cases (i.e. text along a path)
- check if we can reuse/extend/port some existing tools (e.g. gradient, pattern)
- add support for adding shapes like sinus, spiral, etc. (see odf spec for custom shape/enhanced geometry)

ODF support:
------------
- implement full odf loading and saving for all the shapes so we can switch our native format to odf
- use http://netmoc.cpe.ucf.edu/Projects/OpenDocument/TestSuite.html for testing (when they have some more drawing tests)

Dockers:
--------
- port the transform docker to work on flake shapes (should be quite easy) -> jaham

Plugins:
--------
- port the old plugins to work with flake shapes
- port the flatten path plugin
- port the round corners plugin
- port the whirlpinch plugin
- port the zoom tool plugin ???

Filters:
--------
- port the filters to create a document with flake shapes

Cleanup:
--------
- remove dead code as we replace it with new code
- get rid of qt3support classes whereever we can with our limited resources

General:
--------
- consider the old todos and wishes when implementing/porting the above parts
- replace VColor with KoColor


From the usability review of Thomas Zander
------------------------------------------

* Toolbars
  - Toolbars should be persistent					----
  - toolbox to the left by default					----

* Toolbox
  - select tool dialog has title "insert star"				DONE
  - difficult to see which tool is selected				----
  - clicking the "14" icon does not unselect previous tool		DONE
  - add kbd shortcuts to the tools					----
  - make 'ESC' select the 'Select tool'					----


All time favourites :)
-----------------------

BIG TOPICS:
1) create a consistent tool/plugin system
	plugin input:
	-	canvas (drawing, connecting to mouse/keyboard signals)
	plugin output:
	- icon
	- help text
	- options widget
	- command
	- kaction?
2) selection redesign
	- unify object and or node selection?
	- achieve tight selection (exact selection-object collision test)
3) reintroduce nodetool
4) make VObject leaner
5) introduce renderstack. And dont forget to rewrite shadoweffect to use it.

GUI:
-	remove the dialogs which show up when double clicking the strokefillpreview, this job is done
	by "color manager" docker
-	other koffice apps have widgts that may of interest to us, for instance in kpresenter. We should
	try to reuse them.
-	make a UI for the node manipulation tool.
-	rework the stroke/fill docker with preview on the document and apply button.
-	Find a better way to select a color than the color manager. Maybe a popup ?
-	gradient widget: maybe turn the midpoint arrows to black or 3d triangles like in gimp or illu
-	gradient widget: better separate the midpoint arrows from the color stop triangles: put them
	above the gradient bar like in adobe products. the current situation is a bit nasty
	with near together midpoints and colorstops
-	gradient widget: the midpoint arrows are currently hard to hit and modify

REAL BUGS:
-	patterns dont zoom
-	VSelectionTool has an offset error relative to the handle nodes in the VSelection.
-	fix i18n singular/plural
-	crashes in vtext
-	make curve1To, curve2To work
-	vpolylinetool creates beziers where it could create lines
-	Selections can't be undone/redone because there are no selection commands. 
	Add a VSelectNodeCmd and/or a VSelectCmd. (See bug #60438)

TODO:
-	make pattern coords absolute and not relative to the shape
-	VImage
-	VPattern like VImage with embedded binaries instead of paths
-	bring text support back, ideally using fontconfig and freetype, and no xft.
-	improve printing (specifically printing of gradient and pattern fill), 
	should go along with porting to qt4/the new rendering framework
-	select first/last segment's knot if one of each other's knot is selected
-	allow for multiple strokes and fills in VPath which get rendered in the order they occur.
-	use inside/intersection tests in vpath::combine() for changing winding.
-	change flatness test in intersection code to a estimation used in gems code. otherwise
	if the 2 input curves are the same our code runs forever.
-	make VSelection a state pattern
-	try to abstract rendering even more, preferably using kpainter abstraction.
-	make layers tree robust, efficient and scalable.
-	write odf enhanced-path parser (use some code from svgpathparser in lib)

WISHLIST:
-	krita export filter (with layers)
-	add a nice grid-like shape like in Illu and webdraw
-	pdf import filter (based on poppler)

OPTIMIZATION:
-	in VShapeTool and all manipulation tools: store temporary objects so one doesnt
	have to recalculate/regenerate those for second draw() (erasing old shape)
-	make fill/stroke shared so copying for undo/redo is more efficient. Also potentially
	apply this to file format (like OOo does).
-	transform() bbox too and dont recalculate it
-	check places we use sqrt() if these are really necessary (lenny)

MAKE IT NICE:
-	can't we pass VTool::draw() a painter inseatd of each tool creating a painter itself?
-	remove V*Tool::refreshUnit(). call this directly via dialog() instead
-	pass all dialogs a parent
-	think about using ghostscript's flatten algo (see comments in vflatten.cc)
-	why represent opacity as float, not as short?
-	introduce our own "Color drag" class, since we have in addition to rgb also opacity,
	and maybe also gradient info could be dragged later.

NEW IDEAS:
- make VDocument a KoDocument?
- use KParts::plugin for tools?
