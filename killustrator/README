		KIllustrator - Release 0.3
		==========================

1. Introduction
---------------

Welcome to the second preview release of KIllustrator - the vector
drawing program for the K Desktop Environment. The aim of the
KIllustrator project is the development of a freely available
vector-based drawing application similiar to Corel Draw or Adobe
Illustrator. I have started this project because I am tired of
switching to Windows in order to design illustrations for papers or
slides with a modern drawing tool. Now, for the Linux operating system
and of course for other Unixes the Qt toolkit and the KDE project
provide a perfect foundation for this kind of application.

This snapshot release reflects the current development state - only
basic functionality is implemented. Therefore this release is mainly
intended for potential co-developers or end-users interested in
getting a first impression. 

2. Installation
---------------

KIllustrator comes in source code only - you have to compile the
package for yourself. But the configuration and compilation conforms
to the usual GNU autoconf procedure.

After downloading the archive, unpack the distribution with
	gunzip -c killustrator-0.3.tar.gz | tar xvof -
Next, change into the distribution directory 
	cd killustrator-0.3
and invoke
	./configure

The installation requires a working K Desktop Environment (Beta 4 or
better). The current release is tested on Linux and Solaris 2.6 with
gcc-2.8 and egcs-1.0. For image export (JPEG and PNG) the Qt Image I/O
Extension (qimgio) is required. Otherwise only XPM, PPM and GIF is
supported. In addition, ghostscript is required for Encapsulated Postscript
output.

After the successfull configuration compile the project
	make
and install it (optionally)
	make install

If you dislike KIllustrator or in case of an upgrade you should be able to
remove the package with
	make uninstall

3. Features
-----------

As stated before only limited functionality is currently
implemented. Here are some highlights:
- different object types: polylines, circles, ellipses, squares,
  rectangles and multiline text
- tools for creating these objects
- tools for moving, scaling, rotating as well as grouping, ungrouping,
  aligning, distributing and reordering objects
- a multilevel undo/redo facility
- a property editor
- multi-window support with cut/copy/paste between the windows
- zooming and snapping to grid
- multilevel undo/redo
- (network-transparent) drop support with the KDE filemanager
- printing to PostScript (file or printer)
- preliminary WMF support (contributed by Stefan Taferner)
- bezier curves
- symmetric polygons
- arrows 
- editing single points of polylines and curves
- different line styles
- export to raster image formats (JPEG, XPM, GIF, PNG)
- saving/restoring of default object properties

New in release 0.3:
- export to GIF and Encapsulated PostScript
- page layout
- transformation dialog
- rounded rectangles
- arcs and pies
- XML-based file format

The handling follows the Corel Draw(tm) user interface. That means:
- Holding down the control key during object creation produces squares
  resp. circles instead of rectangles or ellipses. 
- Clicking in an existing text object enables the editing of the text
- You can configure a tool by right clicking the activated tool
  button. Currently, this works only for the polygon tool.
- Lines are constructed with left click (this adds a new point) and
  finished with right click.
- Bezier curves are constructed with 4 control points. You have to
  left click 3 times before you can finish the curve segment with the
  right mouse button. But you can add more segments by left clicking
  instead of the right button. Sound confusing ? Try it !

4. Contributions
----------------

The development of this kind of application is surely much
effort. Because I won't spend my whole spare time in coding, I invite
you to participate in the KIllustrator project. First, if you plan to
contribute some code, please contact me in order to avoid duplicate
work. 

Currently the ToDo list for this project is longer than the feature
list, so I give only some points for further development. My plans for
the next release (perhaps this is the first beta release ?):
- redraw optimization
- layers

Other topics:
- object hierarchies
- a freehand drawing tool
- import of xfig files
- support of OpenParts (KOffice) 
- internationalization (at the moment only english and german support
  is included)
- documentation/online help (REALLY IMPORTANT ! I'm looking for
  assistance !)
- designing some nice icons/pixmaps
- ...

Open points:
- replacing the Qt drawing engine by a Display Postscript-based engine
- constraints
- ...

5. Bugs
-------

Of course the current snapshot contains a lot of bugs. Here is a list
of known bugs and limitations:
- session management isn't implemented
- export to raster image consumes a lot of memory
- the drawing code is slow
- no help available
- poorly documented code ;-)

6. Download
-----------

The primary site for downloading the development snapshot and 
additional information is
	http://wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~sattler/killustrator.html
In addition, the sourrce code should available from the KDE ftp site
and it's mirrors:
        ftp://ftp.kde.org
