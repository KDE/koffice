Bug-List
========
KOFFICE VERSION DOES NOT WORK (DUE TO CHANGE TO CANOSSA!)
Note: the koffice related bugs, listed below, do not any longer apply.

------------------------------------
Bugs from above bug page:
* Incomplete WMF support
* Exported EPS files doesn't work well with TeX
  (Qt bug?, see http-page)
  Possibly fixed in "EPSExport.cc        1999/10/19 07:03:38     1.14"
* RGB errors in XFig import filter
* Aligning to grid is not quite right under resize. Draw a small box ~100x100 pt
  and resize it to fit an A4 page. 
------------------------------------

* Transform dialog/proportional doesn't work reliable: the value isn't updated
  always (sometimes Return works) -- maybe check in return sensitivity again.
  (if the numbers are entered and Return is pressed, which triggers the OK
  button, the changes are discarded -- see e.g. setup grid.)

* When using apply in the transformation dialog, the status line is not updated
  When an object is moved using the mouse, the data in the non-model
  transformation dialogue is not updated.

* Keyword/Comment support (see GDocument and DocumentInfo) doesn't really work.
  readFromXml
  Somehow older entries are saved! This can be seen with the new comment and
  keyword fields: create two files, where the length of the fields differ,
  open now the files alternating!

* KIll. crashes sometimes (always) on empty files. (i.e. Kil-File, but without
  anything between  </head> and </doc>.
  Solution: Don't save these files and don't crash, when loading them!

* Available menu commands and toolbar arrangement differ between
  the standardalone version and the koffice version.
  - Recent files don't appear in ko, whereas no icons are shown in the s-alone
  - Page dialog:
    Initially no mini-page is drawn.
  - Toolbar: KO contains redo, undo and delete buttons, which are not present
    in SO; zoom combobox is editable in KO.

* Disableing of the ruler doesn't work (everything is painted in the colour of
  the ruler background) (This is Qt cvs post 2.0.2, pre 2.1.x; KO+SO)

* undo/redo for layers
  Presently delated layers disappear in the nirvana

* if layers are disabled for editing, marked objects still have are marked.
  (this also true for layers disabled for viewing)

* seg points in rotated ellipses

* Order of objects when using Arrange/Align/Distribute

* Unavailable menu items should be greyed out

* UnitBox
  - When changing the units the pt value shouldn't be affected
    (thus ensureing higher preciseness)
  - the fmt string and the stepwidth etc. should be better adapted for
    the different units (especially for the very small and very large ones,
    such as inch/cm and pt/dd)

* Point editing doesn't always obey the Grid and/or auxilary line
  More bugs: You cannot select a point using a fine grid

* Arrange|Transform:
  Proportional doesn't really reliably work.
  In Transformation.cc everything in updateProportionalDimension
  seems to work correct, but somehow the value isn't updated!

* FloatSpinbox: '-' always decreases the value; it should be used to type in a
  negativ number! Enter sometimes decreases the values!

* When using Transformation|Mirror it should be possible to mirror right on the
  place, presently horizontal mirroring moves upwards (analog for vert.)

* Draging helplines out of the ruler doesn't work (yet)
  Need to implement the slot in canvas and the connection in
  standardalone/* and koffice/*.
  Draging  Helplines doesn't work either.

* Align to Helplines doesn't seem to work, if align to grids is unchecked
  Align is to dominative! (test: wide grid + auxline  approx. in the middle)

* Helplines should be drawn atop of everything, else they can be too easily
  hidden (later we might go corels way and put them to a Layer)

* Strings: The XML-Reader uses strings, whereas QStrings are used elsewhere.
  This might lead to unicode problems. (Comment, keywords, typed-in text)

* Gradient: Linear (horizontal) with angle doesn't yet work
  (some hooks in Properties*.*)
