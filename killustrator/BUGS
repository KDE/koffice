------------------------------------
Bugs from above bug page:
* Incomplete WMF support
* Exported EPS files doesn't work well with TeX
  (Qt bug?, see http-page)
* RGB errors in XFig import filter
* Aligning to grid is not quite right under resize. Draw a small box ~100x100 pt
  and resize it to fit an A4 page. 
------------------------------------

* undo/redo for layers
  Presently delated layers disappear in the nirvana

* if layers are disabled for editing, marked objects still have are marked.
  (this also true for layers disabled for viewing)

* seg points in rotated ellipses

* Order of objects when using Arrange/Align/Distribute

* Unavailable menu items should be greyed out

* Translation (not moving)
  Objectname Rectangle and Square are no translatable (at least they are not in
  de.po)

* Default name of Layers ("Layer #1") should be i18n-able

* When alternating the page orientation (menu Layout|Page),
  after the first Landscape <-> Portait change the displayed
  minipage is not updated (the change is internally done correct)

* UnitBox
  - When changing the units the pt value shouldn't be affected
    (thus ensureing higher preciseness)
  - the fmt string and the stepwidth etc. should be better adapted for
    the different units (especially for the very small and very large ones,
    such as inch/cm and pt/dd)

* Point editing doesn't always obey the Grid and/or auxilary line
  More bugs: You cannot select a point using a fine grid

* Arrange|Transform: Choosing relative should reset the values to 0
  percentual isn't always default to 100%
