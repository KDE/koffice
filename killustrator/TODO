TODO-LIST

Small Feature Wishes

* Layers: Undo of deleting

* If the mouse pointer (PointEditTool) is outside an arc/pie, paint an arc, else
  paint a pie

* [Ctrl] makes a circle instead of an ellipse and a sq. instead of a rectangle.
  This switch should also be available when the first point is already set
  (mouse: left button down)
  [Shift] should be made to draw centerbased ellips/rectangles.

* [Tab] should circle to the next object (maybe config: next object in this
  layer in all layers), presently it jumps to the zoom combobox and stays there.

* Make UnitBoxes etc i18n (i.e. comma or \cdot instead of dot as decimal
  seperator; maybe: output '.', except ',' and '·' as '.')

--------------------------------
Bugs and features from the bug and wish website
* [optional] Cross cursors [Torsten Rahn supas121@astrophysik.uni-kiel.de].  
* A textbox tool should be addded. Or, if one double clicks on a box, a marker
  comes up so that text can be added in its interior. If this is done, then text
  alignment within a box should also be available.
  [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com]
* Connectors (a la visio), i.e. lines that connect objects and that are updated
  when the object is moved [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com].
* Possibility to create library objects, and also arrange library objects in
  collections [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com].
* It would be nice if text could be added to lines, i.e. if I double click on a
  line, then I can enter some text in a text box. This text could ideally be
  made either to:
  - follow the line 
  - always be orthogonal to it 
  - always horizontal/vertical 
  [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com]
* When I double click on a textbox, I would like to edit the text directly
  [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com].
* Export to wmf [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com].
* Export interface should be available through a command line interface, so if I
  want to automatically convert all ".kil" files to ".eps", then that should be
  easy to do. (It would certainly be ok if killustrator provided the possibility
  to convert only one file at a time) [Stefan Farestam stefan@tibco.com].
* Zooming in current bounding box [Hagen Höpfner].
* Change the number of corners for symmetrical polygons [Hagen Höpfner].
* When you choose a tool by clocking on it once it draws one object then pops
  back to the selection tool, if you click twice is stays selected and doesn't
  pop back [Paul Campbell paul@chromatic.com].
* You can 'duplicate' an object, by default it appears down and to the right of
  the orignal, and the duplicated object is selected. However if you duplicate
  an object, then immediately move it somewhere else the program remembers the
  distance moved so that if you immediately duplicate again it moves the new
  object the same distance yet again - you can use this feature to make arrays
  of objects easily - this state is forgotten as soon as you perform any other
  action (care must be taken to make objects pin to the side of the page and not
  go out of reach) [Paul Campbell paul@chromatic.com].
* Spline support.
* Autotrace support [Martin Weber Martin.Weber@usa.net].
  See http://homepages.go.com/~martweb/AutoTrace.htm
* A Designworks-like curve tool [Martin Weber Martin.Weber@usa.net].
* More advanced helpline management. [Hagen Höpfner].
* Fit drawing to paper before printing. [Hagen Höpfner].
* Additional paper formats. [Tobias Burnus].
* Shearing, whereby the opposite side is fixed. [Tobias Burnus].
* Converting arbitrary objects into curves. [Tobias Burnus].
* A "Bug report" button. [Gary Lawrence Murphy].
* Moving of objects between layers without copy/paste. [Tobias Burnus].
* An extrusion tool similar to Corel Draw. [Lawrence Commander].
--------------------------------

Projects:
* Import/Export filters: AI, XCF, (CMX) etc.
  PGML: http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-PGML
* Autotrace plugin support, http://homepages.go.com/~martweb/AutoTrace.htm
* WMF import/(export) filter; presently only inserting as QWmfObjects works,
  but this cannot be edited (see Edit|Insert|Clipart)

Bigger ones
* Moving Objects between layers
  (and honor the vertical position, harder for objects which are partly in a
  layer below and above)

* Zoom arbitry values
  If the combobox is editable (see KO version), this seems to work well,
  maybe this needs only a two liner.
  If this is done:
  - Zoom to object

* When zooming using the mouse, the viewport should be centered relative to the
  mouse position, using the combobox the topmost left point should be used
  (presently everything seems to be reverted to (0,0))

* arbitray values for the angle of linear gradient
  (presently: only horizontal and vertical)
* Pattern: Besides no background as second colour, an optional second colour
  should be supported

* Auxilary lines should be moveable by mouse and should be drawable out of the
  rouler
  
* The Beziere line system needs a complete rework:
  We need one line type, of which each node can be either an edge or a bezier
  point (see Corel Draw! for an model)
  -> If this is done the following point should be done

* ConvertToCurve of circles is suboptimal: a circle is converted into a douzend
  of streight lines!
  Rectangles with round edges and arcs/pies converted to circles and
  non-round-edged rectangles

* selecting more than one point should be possible when using the point edit
  tool
