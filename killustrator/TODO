Small Feature Wishes
* Layers: Undo of deleting

* If the mouse pointer (PointEditTool) is outside an arc/pie, paint an arc, else
  paint a pie

* [Ctrl] makes a circle instead of an ellipse and a sq. instead of a rectangle.
  This switch should also be available when the first point is already set
  (mouse: left button down)
  [Shift] should be made to draw centerbased ellips/rectangles.

* Support keywords and comments when saving as XML/.kil

* [Tab] should circle to the next object (maybe config: next object in this
  layer in all layers), presently it jumps to the zoom combobox and stays there.

Bigger ones
* Moving Objects between layers
  (and honor the vertical position, harder for objects which are partly in a
  layer below and above)

* Zoom arbitry values
  If this is done:
  - Zoom to object

* arbitray values for the angle of linear gradient
  (presently: only horizontal and vertical)

* Auxilary lines should be moveable by mouse and should be drawable out of the
  rouler
  
* The Beziere line system needs a complete rework:
  We need one line type, of which each node can be either an edge or a bezier
  point (see Corel Draw! for an model)
  -> If this is done the following point should be done

* ConvertToCurve of circles is suboptimal: a circle is converted into a douzend
  of streight lines!
  Rectangles with round edges and arcs/pies converted to circles and
  non-round-edged rectangles

* selecting more than one point should be possible when using the point edit
  tool
