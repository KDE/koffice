This file describes how the painting of a spreadsheet is supposed to
work. At present, it only describes painting of a cell.


Painting
--------

Each cell is painted by itself.  This means that the border between
cells are painted twice.  (FIXME: Is this true?)


Overflow
--------

In this context, the word Overflow means that the content of a cell is
wider than the cell itself.  In that case, the extra space that is
demanded can be handled in several different ways:
 - The content can be partially shown, i.e. cut.
 - The content can overflow into neighbor cell(s), which ones are
   dependent on alignment, if the neighbors are empty, etc, etc.

Borders and overflow
--------------------

A border that is defined for a cell should never be moved just because
the content of the cell overflows.  Currently (1,4beta1) does that,
but it has to be changed.


Other spreadsheets
------------------

Here follows a survey of how other spreadsheet programs handle
overflow into other cells.  

Note: the table is almost 190 characters wide.

Case				Excel				Gnumeric			Oocalc				KSpread				Suggested behaviour
============================================================================================================================================================================================
Text in cell, Left aligned
--------------------------
Empty cell TtR			Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR
Non-empty cell TtR		Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR

Text in Cell, Right aligned
---------------------------
Empty cell TtL			Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL		Text is cut, arrow TtR		Overflows into cell TtL
Non-empty TtL, empty TtR	Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is left aligned(!),	Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR
												overflows into cell TtR
Non-empty TtL, non-empty TtR	Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is left aligned(!),	Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR
												cut, arrow is drawn TtR

Number in cell, Alignment turned out not to matter
--------------------------------------------------
Generic format	 		Precision is reduced		Precision is reduced		### is shown			############# (cell is filled)	############# (For now)
Number format			############# (cell is filled)	############# (cell is filled)	### is shown			############# (cell is filled)	############# (cell is filled)


Border and overflow, left aligned
---------------------------------
Text format, ordinary cell					Right border is not drawn	Border stays on cell						Border stays on cell
								Text overflows TtR		Text overflows TtR						Text overflows TtR
												Text covers right border					Text covers right border
Text format, merged cell					Gnumeric 1.2.8 can't merge	Border stays on cell						Border stays on cell
								Test with Gnumeric 1.4		Text is cut							Text is cut(?)


Legend
LA	Left Aligned
RA	Right Aligned
TtR	To the Right
TtL	To the Left
