This file describes how the painting of a spreadsheet is supposed to
work. At present, it only describes painting of a cell.


Painting
--------

Each cell is painted by itself.  This means that the border between
cells are painted twice.  (FIXME: Is this true?)



Overflow
--------

In this context, the word Overflow means that the content of a cell is
wider than the cell itself.  In that case, the extra space that is
demanded can be handled in several different ways:
 - The content can be partially shown, i.e. cut.
 - The content can overflow into neighbor cell(s), which ones are
   dependent on alignment, if the neighbors are empty, etc, etc.


The current status of this file is that it is under discussion.


Other spreadsheets
------------------

Here follows a survey of how other spreadsheet programs handle
overflow into other cells.  

Note: the table is almost 190 characters wide.

Case				Excel				Gnumeric			Oocalc				KSpread				Suggested behaviour
============================================================================================================================================================================================
Text in cell, Left aligned
--------------------------
Empty cell TtR			Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR		Overflows into cell TtR
Non-empty cell TtR		Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR		Text is cut, arrow TtR

Text in Cell, Right aligned
---------------------------
Empty cell TtL			Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL		Overflows into cell TtL
Non-empty TtL, empty TtR	Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is left aligned(!),	Bug: overflows TtL,		Text is cut, 
												overflows into cell TtR		arrow is drawn TtR		arrow is drawn TtR
Non-empty TtL, non-empty TtR	Text is cut, no mark		Text is cut, no mark		Text is left aligned(!),	Bug: overflows TtL,		Text is cut, 
												cut, arrow is drawn TtR						arrow is drawn TtR

Number in cell, Alignment turned out not to matter
--------------------------------------------------
Generic format	 		Precision is reduced		Precision is reduced		### is shown			Overflows like text		### (For now)
Number format			############# (cell is filled)	############# (cell is filled)	### is shown			Overflows like text		############# (cell is filled)



Legend
LA	Left Aligned
RA	Right Aligned
TtR	To the Right
TtL	To the Left
