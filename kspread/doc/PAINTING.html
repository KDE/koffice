<h1>KSpread Painting</h1>

<p>This file describes how the painting of a spreadsheet works and is
supposed to work. At present, it is not a complete description.</p>


<h2>General</h2>

<p>Painting is started by Canvas::paintEvent().  This method
calls paintCell() on all visible cells, i.e. it always repaints the
entire sheet.  This is inefficient, but is OK for most circumstances.
There is a bug in bugzilla (#xxxx) which points this out.</p>

<p>Each cell can paint itself.  If a number of cells are explicitly
merged by the user, then the merged cell is painted by a single call
to paintCell() on its upper left corner cell, the "master" cell of the
merged group.  If paintCell() is called on any of the other cells in
the group, a recursive call to paintCell is done on the master cell.
<br>
<b>NOTE</b>: This is not yet implemented.</p>

<p>If the content of a cell is wider than the cell itself, then we say
that this cell <i>overflows</i> and expands into its neighbors (see
<b>Layout</b> below).  Currently this only happens for cells that are
unmerged.  Cells that are merged never expand, but instead show a
<i>more text</i> marker.  See more details about overflow below.</p>

<p>A border between cells is painted twice:
<ul>
  <li>When the cell on one side of the border is drawn.
  <li>When the cell on the other side is drawn.
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>Painting is a two-step process.  First, makeLayout() is called, which
analyzes the content of the cell and checks if it fits into the cell.
If it doesn't, two things can happen:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The cell will be painted with a <i>more text</i> marker (a red
      arrow).

  <li>If the cell is left aligned and the cell to the right is empty,
      the cell can <i>expand</i> into the right cell and obscure it
      with the content of this cell.  If the cell is right aligned,
      the text can overflow to the left instead.  (This is currently
      slightly buggy.)
</ol>

The layout code also takes into account if the cell has vertical text,
if it is angled, indented text, and so on.</p>

<p>The result of the layout process is the setting of the following
variables in a cell:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
<tr>
  <th colspan="2">Values that are calculated during the paint process</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td><pre>d->textX<br>d->textY</pre></td>
 <td>Text position within the cell</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><pre>d->textWidth<br>d->textHeight</pre></td>
  <td>The size of the text</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><pre>d->extra()->extraXCells<br>d->extra()->extraYCells</pre></td>
  <td>Number of extra cells in X and Y direction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><pre>d->extra()->extraWidth<br>d->extra()->extraHeight</pre></td>
  <td>Extra width/height brought in by the extra cells</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><pre>d->strOutText</pre></td>
  <td>The text that is shown in the cell.</td>
</tr>
</pre>
</table>

<p>After the layout process, paintCell() uses these
variables to position the text within the cell and also to paint "more
text" markers, etc.</p>

<p>The value of extra[XY]Cells and extraWidth/Height can be made non-zero
in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The cell is the master cell of a merged group.

  <li>The content is too wide/high, and the cell has expanded into
      neighboring cells.
</ol>

<p>Currently these two cases never occur simultaneously.  That might
change in the future.  So, as for now the two cases can be separated by
checking if d->extra()->merged[XY]Cells are zero (case 2) or non-zero
(case 1).</p>


<h2>Overflow</h2>

<p>In this context, the word <i>overflow</i> means that the content of
a cell is wider than the cell itself.  In that case, the extra space
that is demanded can be handled in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The content can be partially shown, i.e. cut.

  <li>The content can overflow into neighbor cell(s). Which cells that
      are affected is dependent on alignment, if the neighbors are
      empty, etc, etc.  </ul>

<h3>Borders and overflow</h3>

<p>A border that is defined for a cell should never be moved just
because it would be possible, that the content of the cell overflows.
The current version (2.0 alpha) does that, but it has to be changed.</p>


<h3>Other spreadsheets</h3>

<p>Here follows a survey of how a number of spreadsheet programs
handle overflow into other cells.</p>
