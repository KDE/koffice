All tests are run by changing to this directory (using 'cd') and then 
running 'ctest'. If a test fails, run that particular test to see the 
error message(s) in details.

The available tests so far:

  FinancialFunctions
  Formula
  OpenFormula
  RTree
  TrigFunctions
  Value


Some tests are not intended only to check performance
  BenchmarkCluster
  BenchmarkRTree
  
They are not executed using 'ctest', thus you have to run it manually.
