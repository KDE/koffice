Please put your name in "(...)" to the bug/feature you work on or you want to work on.
For bugs: look into the KBugBuster if somebody else is working on it.d




Others bugs not in BT system (Report by - taken by):

- Clicking into canvas causes to much flickering if many items
        (especially multirow cells) are in visible rect
- MultiRow cells will only be drawn if obscuring is forced!
- Merged cells are always obscured by others even if something is in there



Other things: (please add the things you are working on!)

- Zoom
- inserting data from text files
- inserting formated data (csv) from clipboard
- "Freeze/Unfreeze Panes", started but had some problems caused by the
        scrollbars, it works, but not very nice (not commited (Norbert))
- AutoFormat (already exists in a very limited way: Format -> table style)
- Script, Script-Editor (like VBA in Excel)
- Tools->Auditing:
	Trace Precedents
	Trace Dependants
	Trace Error
	Remove all arrows
- GoalSeek
        (You can have an algorithm from me,
        if you are interested in implementing this -  Norbert)
- Printing:
        - expand selection to page
        - fit selection to page
        - print selection only
- Sheet layout:
        - Move sheet properties to seperate dialog (they are currently part of KSpread config dialog)
        - Make headers/footers part of sheet not map (so each sheet has it's own header/footer)
- Scenerios
- Locked areas (for formulas with a matrix as result)
- Multible Operations (in Excel: "Data"->"Table")
- more chart types
- much more formulas (financial,...)
- Scrollbar that supports jumping one row/column forward or back
- Named areas with something like "=x+5" ("='x'+5" works already)
- other bug fixes                               (everybody, every time)

Philipp
=======

- printing enhancements (show real page borders, fix preview, printing headers      (Philipp, haven't started yet)
        on each page, printing a selection only, ...)
- Filter, Autofilter                                             (Philipp, but will take long, haven't started yet)
- Performance improvements at end of ranges - last column/row    (Philipp, started)
- Support "unlimited" columns/rows,
  unlimited means a reasonable defined value                     (Philipp, concept finished, will include after beta1)


Norbert
=======

- insert data from databases                                    (Norbert - almost done)
- Styles                                                        ( after 1.2 cause it requires bigger changes
                                                                  than expected )
- implement more Excel shortcuts like CTRL+Shift+!, *, ^, ...   (Norbert - almost done)
  (see Todo-list below)

Ariya
=====
- more "Related Functions" in function help/desc text
- add more functions (helps welcomed!)
- add support for matrices operation
- improve function compatibility with MS Excel
- more choices for Data -> Consolidate
- dBASE import filter (Done, need some improvements)
- improve/fix MS Excel import filter
- start working on MS Excel export filter (with 'wildfox')
- ported export filter (CSV,html) not to use KoDocument anymore

Explanations to features:
=========================

Named areas:

I would like to ask one thing about "Named areas". In Excel you can assign
names to cells (you can do this in KSpread, too) like this:
        A       B
1       45      46
2
x=A1, y= B1

Now, I would like to put
"=x+y" in A2. This works with Excel but not in KSpread. But it is an important
feature (I was told :-)
So if you evaluate "=x+y", 'x' has be replaced by "A1" and 'y' by "B1"



TODO-List:
----------

Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a table->recalc() or table->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether table->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

Furthermore try stuff like CTRL + SHIFT + # or @ or ! in Excel
This is neat stuff and makes one's life so much more enjoyable.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)

Improvement :
-------------
- Add zoom (Bernd: Yes, this is important. KSpread is much to cluttered
up at this point. you can hardly do any real work with it even on a
17inch screen. Torben? Please?)
-create a script editor for execute script
 (Use KWrite)

Bug fix :
---------
-and also bug fix :)
