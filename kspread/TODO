Please put your name in "(...)" to the bug/feature you work on or you want to work on.
For bugs: look into the KBugBuster if somebody else is working on it.d




Others bugs not in BT system (Report by - taken by):

- Clicking into canvas causes to much flickering if many items
        (especially multirow cells) are in visible rect
	--(John) I've done updates on this, does anyone think this is still
	         a big problem?
        No, I think you fixed it. So Bug #41068 can be closed
        But something else: put something like setZoom( 0.75 ) in 
        the KSpreadView contructor and then mark a big area - this takes forever
        on slow machines.
		 
- MultiRow cells will only be drawn if obscuring is forced!


Other things: (please add the things you are working on!)

- Speed up selecting many cells!
- general speed up!
- WYSIWYG
- insert manual page break
- "Freeze/Unfreeze Panes", started but had some problems caused by the
        scrollbars, it works, but not very nice (not commited (Norbert))
- AutoFormat (already exists in a very limited way: Format -> table style)
- Script, Script-Editor (like VBA in Excel)
- Tools->Auditing:
	Trace Precedents
	Trace Dependants
	Trace Error
	Remove all arrows
- Sheet layout:
        - Move sheet properties to seperate dialog (they are currently part of KSpread config dialog)
- Scenerios
- Locked areas (for formulas with a matrix as result)
- Multible Operations (in Excel: "Data"->"Table") (Norbert)
- Pivot tables
- more chart types
- multible Selections
- background spell check
- links to cells in other kspread files
- much more formulas (financial, database...)
        String2Int, CurrentMonth, CurrentYear, CurrentDay,
- Insert pictures
- Insert basic drawings, autoforms        
- Insert widgets like buttons, drop down lists,... + having the possibily to
  define action if pressed, or selection changes,...
- Transparancy for embedded objects
- z-order for embedded objects (and possibility to change the order)
- better handling of embedded objects: e.g. delete them just by marking them + Del-Key
  not only in the context menu of the borders
- Scrollbar that supports jumping one row/column forward or back
- formula result: fit the precision to the width of the cell
- other bug fixes                               (everybody, every time)


BEGGING: Please: can somebody enhance koScript so that a formula not only gets the values but also
         the references? (e.g.: =DATAAVG(A1:C12, "weight", A1:C12)
         puts a list of values to KSContext (as usual) but also A1:C12 (in something like getRef() which
         returns 0L if there are no references (for the second parameter in the example)
        I designed the database formulas available in Excel and MultipleOperations which both depend
        on this, but I have no idea how to add it.
----I'll take care of this first thing after 1.2. - John        



*********
* Taken:
*********

John
=======

- Formula arguments into the Context structure
- Pulling the cell 'result' into it's own class for future enhancements to 
  calculation precision, new datatypes (matrix?), and cleaner code 
- code cleanups to layout processing (KSpreadCell::makeLayout/setCellText are nightmares!)
- evaluation of how best to increase floating point precision (GnuMP?)

Philipp
=======

- Printing enhancements:
  + Expand selection to page
  + Fit selection to page
  + Print selection only
        
- Filter, Autofilter                                             (but will take long, haven't started yet)
- Performance improvements at end of ranges - last column/row    (started)
- Support "unlimited" columns/rows,
  unlimited means a reasonable defined value                     (concept finished, will include after beta1)


Norbert
=======

- solver (see gnumeric)
- option: ignore duplicate deliminers in CSV import and Insert data from file/clipboard
- CSV export dialog: define deliminers, Table(s), cell content in ".."
- MUST: more than one currency!!
- Style support
- StarCalc/OpenCalc filter (when styles are done)

- Multiple Operations
- Database functions 
- Subtotals
- more information functions (Excel compatible)
=> all four after John is done enhancing KSContext (s.a.)

Ariya
=====
- more "Related Functions" in function help/desc text
- add more functions (helps welcomed!)
- improve function compatibility with MS Excel
- more choices for Data -> Consolidate (Done)
- dBASE import filter (Done, need some improvements)
- dBASE export filter
- ported export filter (CSV,html) not to use KoDocument anymore

Explanations to features:
=========================

Named areas:

I would like to ask one thing about "Named areas". In Excel you can assign
names to cells (you can do this in KSpread, too) like this:
        A       B
1       45      46
2
x=A1, y= B1

Now, I would like to put
"=x+y" in A2. This works with Excel but not in KSpread. But it is an important
feature (I was told :-)
So if you evaluate "=x+y", 'x' has be replaced by "A1" and 'y' by "B1"



TODO-List:
----------

Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a table->recalc() or table->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether table->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)

Improvement :
-------------
- Add zoom (Bernd: Yes, this is important. KSpread is much to cluttered
up at this point. you can hardly do any real work with it even on a
17inch screen. Torben? Please?)
-create a script editor for execute script
 (Use KWrite)

Bug fix :
---------
-and also bug fix :)

Torbens TODO-List:
------------------
- Write-Protect cells
