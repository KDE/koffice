Things not in bugzilla
----------------------



* Printing
  + printouts with zoom other than 100% (it's a missing feature, but  2 ----
    the GUI is there... - page layout, options, Scale Printout )
  
  + make print range work over more than 1 page			      2 ----
  + Make it possible to print embedded objects.			      1 ----
  + Repeated rows and columns don't work if they don't start from     2 ----
    row/column 1.   Also it is not possible to enter just one
    row/column into the dialog, it always has to be a range (2:3).
    - Make repeated rows/cols work with ranges that don't start at 1  2 --
    - Make it possible to enter just one row/column into GUI, don't   2 --
      force a range.


* Features
  + Add text frames and picture frames. It's currently not easy to    2 ----
    insert pictures!
  
* Plugins
  + Replace the calendar templates with 2005 and 2006 (and 2007?)
    NOTE: there is a insert calendar plugin that might be useful.



Analysis of various bugs

* Printing.
  + 68190: Empty document generates 2 printed pages (testcase)
  + 95159: Many blank pages when printing spreadsheet to PDF file.
  + 100643: KSpread prints a completely empty page at the end of
	    the document.

    I thought these bugs would be pretty simple to fix.
    KSpreadCell::needsPrinting() tests for hasProperty(prop) where
    prop is one PTopBorder, PLeftBorder, and so on.  The problem is
    that if an empty cell is saved, it often has style=Default, and
    even though this style has empty borders, it has these bits set in
    the properties field.

    I enhanced the cell inspector (press Ctrl-Shift-I) with a feature
    to see all properties as a hex number, and they were many, even in
    empty cells.  I suspect that the problem comes from saving to a
    file and then loading on the next run.  I can see two ways of
    fixing this, neither of them easy:

    1. Check for empty pen, style, whatever that distinguishes the
       default style at loading time.  I have found no easy way of
       distinguishing the empty border from a non-empty border, but
       those who know KSpread better than I can probably fix it.

    2. In KSpreadCell::needsPrinting(), change the tests for
       hasProperty(...) into something like hasNonemptyProperty(...).
       Again, I don't know how this function should be written.

    SOLVED NOW.  The problem was that the features were set even
    though the fields in the file were null-features (like borders
    with pen == Qt::NoPen and so on).



Things to do after the release of KOffice 1.4
=============================================

* OASIS file format
  + Read OASIS							      1 LAUR
  + Write OASIS							      1 LAUR

* Internals (See also DESIGN.html)
  + Use the new StyleCluster.					      1 RAPH
    This would dramatically reduce memory consumption and allows 
    styles for empty cells.
    - Use new StyleCluster						--
    - Remove old KSpreadFormat						--

  + Speed up selection.						      1 RAPH
    (probably improved with StyleCluster?)
  + Non-continguous selection					      1 ----

  + Rich text in cells.						      1 ----
	Use KoText.

  + code cleanups to layout processing				      1 ----
	(KSpreadCell::makeLayout/setCellText are nightmares!) (Tomas)
	setCellText is no longer a nightmare, makeLayout still is ;)

  + Evaluation of how best to increase floating point precision.      3 ----
	Suggestion:  GnuMP.    (Tomas)
	This will work by converting all functions to compute using
	ValueCalc, and nothing else, then modifying Value* to 
	support GnuMP.  The conversion step shall be done as a part 
	of converting to the new parser.

* GUI
  + Sheet layout:						      2 ----
    - Move sheet properties to separate dialog.
      They are currently part of KSpread config dialog.


* General features
  + Insert manual page break					      2 ----
  + Split view							      1 ----
  + "Freeze/Unfreeze Panes"					      2 ----
	Started but had some problems caused by the scrollbars, it 
	works, but not very nice (not committed (Norbert)).
        Maybe not as important if we get split view to work correctly.

  + Matrix operations						      2 TOMA
      I have plans to do these things in a very clean and simple way.
      The only drawback is that it probably won't be excel-compatible.
      Further research and/or discussion might be needed here.
      I'll inform koffice-devel when the right time comes ;)

  + Locked areas (for formulas with a matrix as result)		      2 TOMA

* Major features (big effort)
  + Script, Script-Editor (like VBA in Excel)			      2 ----
  + Tools->Auditing:						      2 ----
    - Trace Precedents						      2 --
    - Trace Dependants						      2 --
    - Trace Error						      2 --
    - Remove all arrows						      2 --
  + Pivot tables						      3 ----

Other things: (please add the things you are working on!)
(I don't understand these.  Please enter them under the correct heading /Inge)

- Scenarios


Not yet sorted (will be entered into categories above)

- Multible Operations (in Excel: "Data"->"Table") (Norbert)
- Pivot tables
- more chart types
- background spell check (necessary to use kotext)
- links to cells in other kspread files
- much more formulas (financial, database...)
        String2Int, CurrentMonth, CurrentYear, CurrentDay
        See list below
- Insert pictures (Add support for object into kspread)
- Insert basic drawings, autoforms (necessary to create a share lib from kpresenter)
- Insert widgets like buttons, drop down lists,... + having the possibily to
  define action if pressed, or selection changes,...
- Transparancy for embedded objects
- z-order for embedded objects (and possibility to change the order)
- better handling of embedded objects: e.g. delete them just by marking them + Del-Key
  not only in the context menu of the borders
- Scrollbar that supports jumping one row/column forward or back
- formula result: fit the precision to the width of the cell
- other bug fixes                               (everybody, every time)
- interface for mail merge

Philipp
=======

- Printing enhancements:
  + Expand selection to page
  + Fit selection to page
  + Print selection only
        
- Filter, Autofilter                                             (but will take long, haven't started yet)
- Performance improvements at end of ranges - last column/row    (started)
- Support "unlimited" columns/rows,
  unlimited means a reasonable defined value                     (concept finished, will include after beta1)


Norbert
=======

- solver (see gnumeric)  [isn't this done already?]
+ option: ignore duplicate deliminers in CSV import and Insert data from file/clipboard
+ CSV export dialog: define deliminers, Table(s), cell content in '"'
+ more than one currency 
+ enhance the Gnumeric import filter
- sync the Gnumeric export filter
+ Style support
+ StarCalc/OpenCalc import filter
- StarCalc/OpenCalc filter for embedding/embedded objects
+ StarCalc/OpenCalc export filter
- qsa support + recording
- Button + Drop-Down-List support (within cells)
- better AutoFormat dialog + better templates
- new dialog for conditional cell attributes

- Multiple Operations
+ Lookup & Reference functions (LOOKUP needs to fixed)
+ Date/Time functions
+ Database functions 
+ Subtotals
- more information functions (Excel compatible)

Ariya
=====
- more "Related Functions" in function help/desc text
- improve function compatibility with MS Excel
- dBASE export filter
- new formula parser/engine


OpenCalc - filter
=================
- changing text angle should resize the cell height automatically
- conditional cell attribute support is just poor in KSpread: 
  we should be able to assign complete styles (KSpreadLayout objects)
- support for format strings (dd/mm/yyyy)       - Norbert
- more font attributes (outline, shadow,...) + attributes for parts of the text
- double borders
- multiline header/footer support
- for formulas: fit precision so the result fits in the cell or resize the cell
- save m_strOutText in file => no parsing on load  (Norbert)
- save formula results etc in a certain way in the cell (Norbert)

***************************************************************************************

Explanations to features:
=========================

Named areas:

I would like to ask one thing about "Named areas". In Excel you can assign
names to cells (you can do this in KSpread, too) like this:
        A       B
1       45      46
2
x=A1, y= B1

Now, I would like to put
"=x+y" in A2. This works with Excel but not in KSpread. But it is an important
feature (I was told :-)
So if you evaluate "=x+y", 'x' has be replaced by "A1" and 'y' by "B1"



TODO-List:
----------

Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a spread->recalc() or spread->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether spread->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)


Bernd <wuebben@kde.org>


Improvement :
-------------
- Add zoom (Bernd: Yes, this is important. KSpread is much to cluttered
up at this point. you can hardly do any real work with it even on a
17inch screen. Torben? Please?)
-create a script editor for execute script
 (Use KWrite)

Bug fix :
---------
-and also bug fix :)
