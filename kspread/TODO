Others bugs not in BT system (Report by - taken by):

- Clicking into canvas causes to much flickering if many items
        (especially multirow cells) are in visible rect
- MultiRow cells will only be drawn if obscuring is forced!

- Merged cells are always obscured by others even if something is in there
---(John) - I'm not convinced this is a bug.  If you merge a group of cells where
            more than one has text in it, there's no good consistant way to
            "merge" the data.  Currently, the top-left corner cell's data will
            become the large merged cell's data.  Maybe that isn't ideal but 
            what is a better solution?


Other things: (please add the things you are working on!)

- Zoom
- "Freeze/Unfreeze Panes", started but had some problems caused by the
        scrollbars, it works, but not very nice (not commited (Norbert))
- AutoFormat (already exists in a very limited way: Format -> table style)
- Script, Script-Editor (like VBA in Excel)
- Tools->Auditing:
	Trace Precedents
	Trace Dependants
	Trace Error
	Remove all arrows
- Printing:
        - expand selection to page
        - fit selection to page
        - print selection only
- Sheet layout:
        - Move sheet properties to seperate dialog (they are currently part of KSpread config dialog)
- Scenerios
- Locked areas (for formulas with a matrix as result)
- Multible Operations (in Excel: "Data"->"Table")
- Pivot tables
- more chart types
- Styles
- background spell check
- links to other kspread files
- much more formulas (financial, database...)
- Scrollbar that supports jumping one row/column forward or back
- Named areas with something like "=x+5" ("='x'+5" works already)
- other bug fixes                               (everybody, every time)

John
=======

- Reimplimenting the "obscuring" structure of cells -- there is currently no
  way to keep track of a cell being obscured by more than one other cell.

- various painting issues.  Cell borders aren't always painted/cleared correctly
  and the entire canvas painting routines are far too complex.  

- Pulling the cell 'result' into it's own class for future enhancements to 
  calculation precision, new datatypes (matrix?), and cleaner code (KSpreadCell
  is absolutely HUGE)
  -- I haven't started on this and may not for several weeks so let me know if
     you want to take this.

Philipp
=======

- printing enhancements (printing a selection only, ...)       (Philipp)
        
- Filter, Autofilter                                             (Philipp, but will take long, haven't started yet)
- Performance improvements at end of ranges - last column/row    (Philipp, started)
- Support "unlimited" columns/rows,
  unlimited means a reasonable defined value                     (Philipp, concept finished, will include after beta1)


Norbert
=======

- Functions that belongs in Excel to "Information"

Ariya
=====
- more "Related Functions" in function help/desc text
- add more functions (helps welcomed!)
- add support for matrices operation
- improve function compatibility with MS Excel
- more choices for Data -> Consolidate (Done)
- dBASE import filter (Done, need some improvements)
- improve/fix MS Excel import filter
- start working on MS Excel export filter (with 'wildfox')
- ported export filter (CSV,html) not to use KoDocument anymore

Explanations to features:
=========================

Named areas:

I would like to ask one thing about "Named areas". In Excel you can assign
names to cells (you can do this in KSpread, too) like this:
        A       B
1       45      46
2
x=A1, y= B1

Now, I would like to put
"=x+y" in A2. This works with Excel but not in KSpread. But it is an important
feature (I was told :-)
So if you evaluate "=x+y", 'x' has be replaced by "A1" and 'y' by "B1"



TODO-List:
----------

Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a table->recalc() or table->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether table->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)

Improvement :
-------------
- Add zoom (Bernd: Yes, this is important. KSpread is much to cluttered
up at this point. you can hardly do any real work with it even on a
17inch screen. Torben? Please?)
-create a script editor for execute script
 (Use KWrite)

Bug fix :
---------
-and also bug fix :)

- Write-Protect cells
