Norbert
=======

- AutoCompletion/AutoContinuation for dates, times, for values like:
        "1,3,4,6", more Excel-like behavior                     (Norbert - done beta2)

Explanations to features:
=========================

Named areas:

I would like to ask one thing about "Named areas". In Excel you can assign
names to cells (you can do this in KSpread, too) like this:
        A       B
1       45      46
2
x=A1, y= B1

Now, I would like to put
"=x+y" in A2. This works with Excel but not in KSpread. But it is an important
feature (I was told :-)
So if you evaluate "=x+y", 'x' has be replaced by "A1" and 'y' by "B1"



TODO-List:
----------

Please everyone working on KSpread:

Get yourself a copy of Excel 97 or 2000 and create
a really big sheet, and I mean really big and insert Graphs and
lots of dependencies and regressions etc. use external add-ins if you have any
and real time links. Make links between sheets and then see how
well Excel behaves.

1. UNDERSTAND that putting a table->recalc() or table->recalc(true) in
your code is an abosolute NO-NO! Complex spreadsheets with possible
heavy mathematical calculations via dll/so add-ins as well as real
time feeds will not be managable if you do not painstakingly check
wether table->getAutoCalc() is true.


2. Learn to understand that without the
following short cut actions you are lost ( try to scroll
down a list of 10,000 obersvations ...not using CTRL Down
for example)

CTRL Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Shift Up/Down/Left/Right
CTRL Home/End
CTRL Shift Home/End
Shift F9 versus F9

Let's try to get them working well in Kspread as well. I tried my
hand at it but wasn't able to get them to be efficient.

Furthermore try stuff like CTRL + SHIFT + # or @ or ! in Excel
This is neat stuff and makes one's life so much more enjoyable.

3. Familiarize yourself with the concept of array formulas and why they
are necessary (area protection, partial argument evaluation) Who would
be willing to implement them? This will be an absolute must if we
want to make progress on the mathematical/financial/statistical
function side of things. I would be willing to implement a miriad
of these functions but I believe doing that without having array
formulae first will be a big mistake.

(In case you wonder why I feel so strongly about these things:
I am a professional user of Excel. I eat, sleap and work with Excel
on my trading desk on Wall-Street.)

Improvement :
-------------
- Add zoom (Bernd: Yes, this is important. KSpread is much to cluttered
up at this point. you can hardly do any real work with it even on a
17inch screen. Torben? Please?)
-create a script editor for execute script
 (Use KWrite)

Bug fix :
---------
-and also bug fix :)
