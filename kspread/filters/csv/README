This is an experimental CSV filter for kspread.
I'm not sure it is properly located (koffice/filters contains OLE filters only
up to now), but do we want koffice/olefilters and koffice/textfilters and so on,
or do we want everything in koffice/filters/, as it is now ?

BTW, it does not work. It will soon, though ;)
It doesn't even read the input file. But I want to make sure it's activated first...
