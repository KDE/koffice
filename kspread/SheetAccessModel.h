     * @brief Class that can be used by any shape embedded in KSpread to access sheet data,
     * without the need to link against KSpread. It is available through the Doc's data center map,
     * or KoShapeLoadingContext::dataCenterMap() in the process of loading a shape from ODF.
     *
     * Essentially, this model is a list of models to access a sheet's data. It contains a single row,
     * and has exactly one sheet model per column. In short, a model containing models.
     *
     * To access the QAbstractItemModel instance for a sheet's data, take the following code as example:
     * @code
     * QAbstractItemModel *sheetAccessModel = dynamic_cast<QAbstractItemModel*>( dataCenterMap["SheetAccessModel"] );
     * QModelIndex firstSheetIndex = sheetAccessModel->index( 0, 0 );
     * QPointer<QAbstractItemModel> firstSheet = sheetAccessModel->data( firstSheetIndex ).value< QPointer<QAbstractItemModel> >();
     * view->setModel( firstSheet.data() );
     * @endcode
