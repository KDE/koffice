                          README for KSpread


This is the source tree for KSpread, the KOffice spreadsheet program.

If you are a developer, you will find more information in the doc/
directory.  Beware that at the current point of time (2.1 beta2), not
all information there may be up to date.  The main task list can be
found in ./TODO.  Note that this file may also contain some out of
date information.

If you are a user, you will find more user-oriented information in
doc/kspread in the top directory of KOffice.
