BUGS :
======
- Text editor :
  - fix Home, End (they bring to the beginning/end of the document!)
    also CTRL-A, CTRL-E, etc.
  - copy&paste with mouse (MMB) bugs (ah, QT 2 bug)
    '^' + 'e' = 'e' !
  - selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
- Make loading/saveing embedded objs working

MISSING FEATURES, todo :
==============================
- Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
  (using kapp->getConfig)
- Window title : kpresenter - filename
- Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
  way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
- use libkformula
- seperate the general configuration and page/slide specific config dialog
  and make 2 out of them (currently it's one, which is confusing)
- use GM in all dialogs
- Presentation structure editor/viewer (finish it)
- Rewrite autoforms (using XML)
- Insert pagenumber into txt objs
- Group objects
- Possibility to print 1, 2 or 4 slides / page
