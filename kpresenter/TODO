BUGS :
======
Text editor : fix Home, End, ....
   copy&paste with mouse (MMB) bugs (ah, QT 2 bug)
   '^' + 'e' = 'e' !
   selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
   paragraph spacing doesn't apply to several paragraphs selected together

MISSING FEATURES :
==================
Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
  (using kapp->getConfig)
View current page full-screen
Resize an image keeping contrainsts (e.g. Ctrl+click)
Window title : kpresenter - filename
Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
 way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
At the moment all the objects simply appear at a certain moment and stay there
 forever. What about letting them vanish again (probably with a nice effect
 e.g. explode, dissolve, tear apart,...). Maybe it is even possible to achieve
 some irritating flashing-effects :)
