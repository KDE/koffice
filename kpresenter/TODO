BUGS :
======
- Text editor : 
  - fix Home, End (they bring to the beginning/end of the document!)
  - fix Esc : should exit edit mode (currently inserts non-visible char!)
  - copy&paste with mouse (MMB) bugs (ah, QT 2 bug)
    '^' + 'e' = 'e' !
  - selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
  - enumerated list / unsorted list / normal text : don't work if not in edit mode
- adding a new page (from template) changes the width & height of the 
  whole presentation (if different from the one of the template)

MISSING FEATURES :
==================
- Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
  (using kapp->getConfig)
- Window title : kpresenter - filename
- Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
  way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
- Copy page
