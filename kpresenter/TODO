BUGS :
======
- Text editor :
  - fix Home, End (they bring to the beginning/end of the document!)
    also CTRL-A, CTRL-E, etc.
  - copy&paste with mouse (MMB) bugs (ah, QT 2 bug)
    '^' + 'e' = 'e' !
  - selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
  - Replacing selected text works not correctly, e.g. following happens
    Write This is my text.
    select "my " and type "a ", it will first remove "my ",
    so the new text is "This is text", and then insert a at the position the
    cursor was, so you end up with "This is texa t" instead of "This is a text".
  - When selecting a whole line and changing attribs, a word in next and/or prev line
    is changed too 
- Placing of objects is not precise 
- When pasting a page set default page to currentPage + 1


TO FINISH:
===========
- Presentation structure editor/viewer
- Group objects (resizing is fucked up, set properties doesn´t work)

MISSING FEATURES / TODO:
==============================
- Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
  (using kapp->getConfig)
- Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
  way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
- use libkformula
- seperate the general configuration and page/slide specific config dialog
  and make 2 out of them (currently it's one, which is confusing)
- use GM in all dialogs
- Rewrite autoforms (using XML)
- Possibility to print 1, 2 or 4 slides / page
- Menu item for copy page (to do it without copy+paste)
- Extend Contents to Height => Fit contents to height (also shrink spacings!)
  Maybe don´t only change spacings but also fontsizes
- Make option for txt obj to be abe to set a few colors and automatically use
  them in this order for the paragraphs (like always one in black and one in blue and
  again and again)
