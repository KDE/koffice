BUGS :
======
Text editor : fix Home, End, .... 
   copy&paste with mouse (MMB) bugs (ah, QT 2 bug)
   '^' + 'e' = 'e' !
   selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
   paragraph spacing doesn't apply to several paragraphs selected together
Assigning a pen to an image (in order to draw a border around it) doesn't work
Insert a picture (F2), then change it on the hard disk, remove the picture from
 kpresenter, and try to insert it again : it gets cached, and the old one gets inserted.
 Only workaround : renaming the file.

MISSING FEATURES :
==================
Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
  (using kapp->getConfig)
View current page full-screen
Resize an image keeping contrainsts (e.g. Ctrl+click)
Window title : kpresenter - filename
Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a 
 way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
