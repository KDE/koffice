BUGS :
======
- Text editor :
  - selecting several lines : first line gets unselected
  - When selecting a whole line and changing attribs, a word in next and/or prev line
    is changed too
- Placing of objects is not precise

TO FINISH:
===========
- Presentation structure editor/viewer
- Group objects (resizing is fucked up, set properties doesn't work)

MISSING FEATURES / TODO:
==============================
- Current "align objects" aligns in relation with the page, is there a
  way to align the h or v centers of several objects ?
- use libkformula (or better, make a KPart out of it)
- seperate the general configuration and page/slide specific config dialog
  and make 2 out of them (currently it's one, which is confusing)
- use GM in all dialogs
- Rewrite autoforms (using XML)
- Possibility to print 1, 2 or 4 slides / page
- Menu item for copy page (to do it without copy+paste)
- Extend Contents to Height => Fit contents to height (also shrink spacings!)
  Maybe don´t only change spacings but also fontsizes
- Make option for txt obj to be abe to set a few colors and automatically use
  them in this order for the paragraphs (like always one in black and one in blue and
  again and again)
- Synchronize object background and page background => object can't load picture and page can't use different brush type.

KOffice in general:
=======================
- koTemplateChooseDia:
  - Restart with last presentation (suggesting it in initial "open" dialog)
    (using kapp->getConfig)
