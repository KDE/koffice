Reggie, 2.4.1999:
-----------------

  - If a text is dropped into a KPresenter Page, a text object
    with the dropped text is inserted into the presentation
  - If a url (list of urls) is dropped into a KPresenter page,
    KPresenter tries to open the urls (image/* mimetypes are opened
    as pixmap objects, all others are opened as textobjects at the moment)

  during a screen presentation. Then it's possible to choose the page to which you want
  to jump.
- Added a menu entry to the screen presentation menu to be able to exit a screen presentation
  using this menu too

- Headers/Footers are correctly drawn in screen presentations now

Reggie, 10.5.1999:
------------------
- More work on editing headers/footers
- Implemented "Extend contents to object height" feature for textobjects
  (this means the linespacing/paragraphspacing is set to values then,
   so that the text fills the whole object rectangle)

------------------
- DnD Fixes
- Implemented configuration of background and frame for headers and footers

Reggie, 13.5.1999:

Reggie, 15.5.1999:
------------------
- Big code cleanups:
  - Using a better readable coding style
  - Lots of classes were derived from QObject but didn't
    make any use of that => these classes aren't derived from
    QObject anymore and no moc files are creaded for these
    classes anymore => faster compilation
  - Fixed includes (Only really neccessary headers are included in the .h files)
- Fixes for Unicode
- Some focus handling fixes
- Fix for loading pixmaps
- Fixed calcutaion of current page number

Reggie, 16.5.1999:
------------------
- More fixes for loading pixmaps
- Removed code in effectdia which was commented out
- Fixed setting pen and brush for pixmaps
  (of course a brush is only visible if the pixmap is transparent)
- Fixed selecting rotated objects
- Fixed some problems with toolbar icons
- Fixed bug reported by David:
   Insert a picture (F2), then change it on the hard disk, remove the picture from
   kpresenter, and try to insert it again : it gets cached, and the old one gets inserted.
- Removed some uselsess stuff
- Updated TODO file

Reggie, 17 - 19.5.1999:
-----------------------
- I completely rewrote the pixmap handling in KPresenter (finally got rid of some really ugly hacks):
  - Splitted KPPixmapCollection into two parts (KPPixmapCollection and KPPixmapDataCollection). Inserting
    pixmaps and lookups are faster now as I'm using QMaps. Also the code is much shorter
    and ref-counting finally works :-)
  - Loading/Changing pixmaps/background pixmaps is much faster, because there is no need anymore to convert
    a pixmap to an internal KPresenter pixmap format
  - Saving/Loading pixmaps in(to) documents is cleaner and faster now: I'm using the features of KoStore
  - Old presentations can be still opened (I added some convert-functions for compatibility)

I didn't test the new pixmap stuff a lot yet, so there may be some bugs in it. I'll do more
testing tomorrow...

- Fixed loading templates and loading docs using the template dialog (Also stores and embedded parts
  are loaded in these cases correctly)

- fix in saving pixmap key

Reggie, 20.5.1999:
------------------
- Fixed drawing background and borders Textobjects and embedded Partobjects
  (background and borders were not rotated when the object was rotated)

Reggie, 22 - 23.5.1999:
-----------------------
- Small fixes in the pixmap collection
- Implemented a clipart collection simlar to the pixmap collection
- Cliparts are now saved into KPresenter docments (using KoStore)
  (old docs can be still loaded)

Reggie, 26.5.1999:
------------------
- Started implementing the option to let objects disappear in screenpresentations: Configuration,
  Loading/Saving and Undo/Redo already works. I'll implement the disappearing (with effects of course :-)
  tomorrow...

Reggie, 28.5.1999:
------------------
- Some QStrList -> QStringList
- Some QList -> QValueList
  (no stuff like 'QList<int> lst; lst.append( new int( 3 ) );' needed anymore :-)
- Objects disappearing in screenpresentations works (ony without effects at the moment,
  but effects will come!)
- Creating webpresentations works again (API of QWizard changed a bit...)

Reggie, 30.5.1999:
------------------
- Setting linespacing, parag-dist (before and after) and depth is applied
  to all selected parags if there are selected some.
- First effects for disappearing objects are working (go to left, right, top and bottom)

Reggie, 31.5.1999:
------------------
- Fixes in effects for disappearing objs
- Implemented more effects for disappearing objs

Reggie, 1.6.1999:
-----------------

Reggie, 2.6.1999:
-----------------

Reggie, 5.6.1999:
-----------------
- KRect/KPoint/KSize -> QRect/QPoint/QSize
- Some source cleanups
- More work on copying pages

Reggie, 6.6.1999:
-----------------
- It's now possible to choose for screenpresentations, if
  - all slides should be shown
  - only the current slide should be shown (that's the slide/page which is the current one in edit mode
    at the moment)
  - selected ones should be shown (you can select them in a listview)
  All this configuration can be done in the page-config dialog (menu Screenpresentations).
  The second point (only current slide) is also convinient, when you are just creating/editing
  a presentation to view only the slide on which you currently are working for testing :-)

Reggie, 11.6.1999:
------------------
- Fixed saving pixmap collection (pixmaps which are
  only in the undo-buffer but not really used anymore
  are not saved)
