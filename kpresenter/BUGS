These are known bugs:
---------------------

Here I just note the known bugs, and if I know a solution, I also note it here. So I know
what there is todeo when I'll do the bugfix.

1. Insert two pictures, move the first one => segfault if second pic has to be redrawn
   (workaround needed, perhaps problem with painter->drawPixmap)
   The best would be to let KImage draw the pictures!

2. When moving/resizing a clipart => clipart looses lines (make clipping rect one pixel larger, or objsize larger)

3. When having multiple views, and a repaint with a clipping rect (in kpresenter_doc) is done, the diffx/diffy from
   the active view is used for all views => incorrect repaint in other views. Solution: don't calc the diffx/diffy into
   the clipping rect, calc the final clipping rect in the repaint-methode using the diffx/diffy of every current view.

4. FIXED. (was textobj focus problem)
