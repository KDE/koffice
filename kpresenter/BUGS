These are known bugs:
---------------------

Here I just note the known bugs, and if I know a solution, I also note it here. So I know
what there is todo when I'll do the bugfix.

1. FIXED. (was picture bug). But I want to do it with KImage one time.

2. When moving/resizing a clipart => clipart looses lines (make clipping rect one pixel larger, or objsize smaller)

3. FIXED. (was bug with repaint of multiple views)

4. FIXED. (was textobj focus problem)

5. In screenpresentations the y-pos of objects isn't calculated cleanly.
