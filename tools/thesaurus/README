README for Thesaurus KDataTool
Daniel Naber (daniel.naber@t-online.de), 2001-10-30

Currently this is a frontend to Wordnet 1.7. Wordnet is "an online lexical reference
system whose design is inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
memory." However, here it is used mainly as a thesaurus. Only the English language is
supported.

To use this you have to download Wordnet (11MB):
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

Technically, this is a KDataTool, which means that it will typically
add an action to a context menu, in this case: "Show related words".
You can see this in KWord when you click the right mouse button
over a word or over selected text.

The Thesaurus KDataTool just calls the wordnet binary "wn", which has to
be in your path. The advantage is that there are no dependencies at compile
time, as there would be if we used the Wordnet library.

TODO:
-Integrate other sources of data, e.g. AikSaurus (http://www.aiksaurus.com/)
