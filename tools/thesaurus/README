README for Thesaurus KDataTool
Daniel Naber (daniel.naber@t-online.de), 2001-11-17

Currently this is a frontend to WordNet 1.7. WordNet is "an online
lexical reference system whose design is inspired by current
psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory." Only the English
language is supported.

To use this you have to download WordNet (11MB):
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

Technically, this is a KDataTool, which means that it will typically
add an action to a context menu, in this case: "Show related words".
You can see this in KWord when you click the right mouse button over
a word or over selected text.

The Thesaurus KDataTool just calls the WordNet binary "wn", which has
to be in your path. The advantage is that there are no dependencies
at compile time, as there would be if we used the WordNet library.

TODO:
-Extract synonym information from WordNet so that we can distribute it
 (if it's <= 1MB tarred). Asking for synonyms returns the synset (e.g. car
 -> "car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar") and the first level
 of hypernyms (e.g. "motor vehicle, automotive vehicle", i.e. more general
 terms). One can also get hyponyms (e.g. "cab, hack, taxi, taxicab")
