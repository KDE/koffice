  \class QTextEdit qtextedit.h
  \brief The QTextEdit widget provides a sophisticated single-page text editor.

  \ingroup basic

  QTextEdit is an advanced WYSIWYG editor supporting rich text
  formatting. It is optimized to handle large text documents and
  respond quickly to user input.

  If you create a new an empty QTextEdit, and want to allow the user
  to edit rich text (HTML), call setTextFormat(Qt::RichText) to be
  sure that text() returns the formatted text.

  QTextEdit extends QTextView with keyboard and mouse handling for
  user input and functions to set/get/modify formatting, text, etc.

  As it is derived from QTextView, it supports the same functions to
  set and load plain and HTML text. Using the save() function, the
  current contents can also be saved in HTML.

  QTextEdit internally works on paragraphs. A paragraph is a formatted
  string which is word-wrapped to fit into the width of the
  widget. Paragraphs are seperated by hard breaks.

  For user input selections are important. To work with selections use
  setSelection() and QTextView::getSelection(). To set or get the
  position of the cursor use setCursorPosition() or
  getCursorPosition().

  To change the current format (the format at the cursor position) or
  the format of a selection, use setBold(), setItalic(),
  setUnderline(), setFamily(), setPointSize(), setFont() or
  setColor(). To change paragraph formatting use setAlignment() or
  setParagType(). When the cursor is moved, the signals
  currentFontChanged(), currentColorChanged() and
  currentAlignmentChanged() are emitted to inform about the format at
  the cursor position.

  To insert text at the cursor position use insert(). cut(), copy()
  and paste() can also be done through the API. If the text changes,
  the textChanged() signal is emitted, and if the user inserts a new
  line by pressing return/enter returnPressed() is emitted.

  QTextEdit provides command-based undo/redo. To set the depth of the
  command history use setUndoDepth() - it defaults to 100 steps. To
  undo or redo the last opetarion call undo() or redo(). The signals
  undoAvailable() and redoAvailable() inform about when undo or redo
  operations can be executed.

  Here is a list of key-bindings which are implemented for editing

  <ul>
  <li><i> Left Arrow </i> Move the cursor one character leftwards
  <li><i> Right Arrow </i> Move the cursor one character rightwards
  <li><i> Up Arrow </i> Move the cursor one line upwards

  <li><i> Page Down </i> Move the cursor one page downwards
  <li><i> Backspace </i> Delete the character to the left of the cursor
  <li><i> Home </i> Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
  <li><i> End </i> Move the cursor to the end of the line
  <li><i> Delete </i> Delete the character to the right of the cursor
  <li><i> Shift - Left Arrow </i> Mark text one character leftwards
  <li><i> Shift - Right Arrow </i> Mark text one character rightwards
  <li><i> Control-A </i> Move the cursor to the beginning of the line
  <li><i> Control-B </i> Move the cursor one character leftwards
  <li><i> Control-C </i> Copy the marked text to the clipboard
  <li><i> Control-D </i> Delete the character to the right of the cursor
  <li><i> Control-E </i> Move the cursor to the end of the line
  <li><i> Control-F </i> Move the cursor one character rightwards
  <li><i> Control-H </i> Delete the character to the left of the cursor
  <li><i> Control-K </i> Delete to end of line
  <li><i> Control-N </i> Move the cursor one line downwards
  <li><i> Control-P </i> Move the cursor one line upwards
  <li><i> Control-V </i> Paste the clipboard text into line edit
  <li><i> Control-X </i> Cut the marked text, copy to clipboard
  <li><i> Control-Z </i> Undo the last operation
  <li><i> Control-Y </i> Redo the last operation
  <li><i> Control - Left Arrow </i> Move the cursor one word leftwards
  <li><i> Control - Right Arrow </i> Move the cursor one word rightwards
  <li><i> Control - Up Arrow </i> Move the cursor one word upwards
  <li><i> Control - Down Arrow </i> Move the cursor one word downwards
  <li><i> Control - Home Arrow </i> Move the cursor to the beginning of the text
  <li><i> Control - End Arrow </i> Move the cursor to the end of the text
  </ul>

  In addition, the following key bindings are supported only Windows:

  <ul>
  <li><i> Shift - Delete </i> Cut the marked text, copy to clipboard
  <li><i> Shift - Insert </i> Paste the clipboard text into line edit
  <li><i> Control - Insert </i> Copy the marked text to the clipboard
  </ul>

  All other keys with valid ASCII codes insert themselves into the
  text at the cursor position.
