Krita

* Fix Bug 109913: Crashes after drawing box, making selection then filling 
  selection with gradient. Also fixes bugs: 111484, 111629, 112029.

Karbon

* Made transform docker do something usable.
* Improved shadow tool and fixed saving shadows as seperate objects for now (#92987, #92982)
* Fixed loading and saving of text basepath and font properties
* Do not trigger text tracing/repaining if we are only initializing the options dialog
* Only repaint inside objects bounding boxes
* When dragging a path to place text along, pressing shift makes the path "jump" in 45 degree steps
* Create text with horizontal path when just clicking with texttool
* Always initialize with selected object when showing the tool dialog
* Only show tool dialog when an object is selected
* Made texttool selection changing (triggers views selection changed signal)
* Always repaint bounding rect of edited text when changed
* Set all shadow options properly in tool dialog
* Cancel tool when pressing cancel button
* When inserting a new object in front of another, set the new objects parent and invalidate the groups bounding box
* When grouping objects, remove all objects from their corresponding parent
* Enabling the group/ungroup menu item when selecting objects from layer list view
* The polyline tool was broken. When you clicked to place a point (after the first one), the point was always placed with x=0
* Fix for karbon crashing on clicking the pattern button in the toolbox
* Make sure, items representing an object without a proper parent are removed as well
* Improved selection tool which now has the following abilities:
  - left mouse click to select single object
  - ctrl + left mouse click to add to current selection
  - ctrl + right mouse click to remove from current selection
  - ctrl + left mouse drag to add objects within selection rect to current selection
  - ctrl + right mouse drag to remove objects within selection rect from current selection
  - presssing shift while scaling makes scaling keeping the aspect ratio (adjusted to shape tool behaviour)
* Fix a drawing bug when selecting objects
* Object/layer listview is now better synced to the documents object hierarchy when deleting or grouping/ungrouping objects
* Enabled multi-selection within the layer listview
* Object/layer listview items get automatically selected when selecting their corresponding object with the selection tool
* Visiblity and locking states are now set correctly from the layer listview
* When embeded zoom the drawing so that it's completely visible
* Make this statusbar text label stretchable, so the rest of the labels won't jump around
* Filter SVG: Added reading of group names
* Filter SVG: Fix percentage loading error
* Filter SVG: Don't lock up on svg document loading
* Text object names are not loaded (#111269)
* Text stroke isn't loaded (#111268)
* Usability: Layers open themself -> only open layer list items when inserting them into list (#111206)
* Usability: Copy/Paste over layers is not consistent (#111203)
* Usability: Current layer looses selection (#111201)
    - always select layer list item corresponding to active layer
    - delete layer list items when undoing VLayerCommand
    - do not allow to delete last layer (see also #111210)
* Layer deletion doesn't get saved (#111148)
* Crash when changing the color of more than one element (#111147)
* Export only exports the first layer (#111144)
