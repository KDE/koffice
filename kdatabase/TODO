TODO?  Pretty much everything!

The idea here is to build a desktop database appplication in the KOffice
framework.

So far, its just a few GUI components, and the rest is yet to be written. 
I'm neither a KDE expert (but I'm learning), nor am I a database expert, but
I'm hoping that with enough time, and help from interested parties, we can
supply this sorely-missing piece of the KDE Office suite.

One thing, possibly the only thing, I am not open to suggestions on is
whether or not this should have its own file format.  In other words, don't
try to convince me it should just be a front-end for existing databases.  I
do hope to extend it to connect to external data sources, but that's a
nice-to-have extra, not the primary goal.

In the end, this is what I envision.

A SQL-compliant desktop database app, including programmable forms, possibly
reporting functionality, and import/export functionality to other databases,
as well as direct connectivity to the external data sources for its
programmable forms.  A huge undertaking, if it comes to fruition, but then
again, KDE and KOffice today are huge and awesome, so it's definitely an
attainable goal.
