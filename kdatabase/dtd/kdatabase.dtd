This is an XML document type definition (DTD) for the KDatabase document format.
Written by Chris Machemer <machey@ceinetworks.com>.

About the version
=================

This is the first version of the DTD  for KDatabase.  I used the KWord dtd as an example and just
started hacking away at it.  I'm sure a lot will be added and/or changed in the near future.

KDatabase overview
==============

The main structure of each KDatabase document is composed of two parts:  structure information, and data.

The structure information holds everything pertaining to database structure, including the table definitions, the
SQL for the views and reports (along with their layout information, and in the future, form information, possibly
written with KBasic.

And the table data area should be self-explanatory.

Some basic notes on XML
=======================

- All kinds of numbers are stored like this: foo="1" (between " and " :)

- A rational number looks like this: width="1.03" (note: the '.' separates
integer and fractional parts).

- <XYZ foo="100" bar="0"/> equals <XYZ foo="100" bar="0"></XYZ>

- Unicode-letters (UTF-8 coded) are used to store the text
(TODO/FIXME: KWord uses UTF-8. However XML can be coded in something else as long as it is correctly declared.)

- Some special characters ('<', '>', '&', '"', ''') are or can be "escaped" ('&lt;', '&gt;', '&amp;', '&quot;', '&apos;')
(TODO: document that these five character references are the only ones allowed for KWord.)

- Please launch KDatabase and save an empty file - it is much easier to follow
this documentation if you wade through an (almost empty) example document.

- The XML begins with a special tag like this:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

Each file starts with this tag. Note: You must not "close" this tag (i.e.
don't put a </?xml...> at the end of the file!).
