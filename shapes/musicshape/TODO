This is just a list with some items that I think would be nice to have some day in the music
flake. The list is in no particular order.

- Save an svg/odg and/or png version of music in addition to what currently is saved to
  make it possible to view/print music in other odf supporting applications.
- Allow multi-page pieces of music by making it possible to spread a piece of music over
  multiple shapes.
- Add some method of editing music with your normal keyboard, perhaps similar to Finale's
  Speedy entry tool.
- Implement selections and cut/copy/paste.
- Implement all kinds of other dynamics and stuff.
