		==========================

 Features
-----------

Here is a short description of currently implemented features: 
- different object types: polylines, freehand lines, circles,
  ellipses, squares, rectangles, symmetric polygones,
  bezier curves, multiline text, raster images
- tools for creating these objects
- tools for moving, scaling, rotating, shearing as well as
  grouping, ungrouping, aligning, distributing and
  reordering objects
- a property editor
- multi-window support with cut/copy/paste between the windows
- zooming and snapping to grid
- multi-level undo and redo
- (network-transparent) drop support with the KDE filemanager
- printing to PostScript (file or printer)
- Import of WMF-Cliparts (Thanks to Stefan Taferner)
- editing, inserting and deleting single points of polylines and curves
- different line styles and arrows
- export to raster image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, XPM)
- saving/restoring of default object properties
- export to Encapsulated PostScript
- page layout
- transformation dialog
- rounded rectangles
- fill styles: pattern and gradients
- Closed (and fillable) bezier curves
- arcs and pies
- Graphical layers
- Alignment of text
- XML-based file format
- Support for different measurement units: inches, millimeter, points
- Alignment of text to path. Supported pathes are polylines, bezier curves,
  polygons and ellipses
- An outline mode
- Blending of objects
- Configuring of tools by double click.
- Inserting and deleting of points in polylines and curves.
- KDE session management
- Help lines
- Online documentation
- A rudimentary Xfig import filter:
  * Support for 3.1 and 3.2 files
  * Splines not implemented

The handling follows the Corel Draw(tm) user interface. That means:
- Holding down the control key during object creation
  produces squares resp. circles instead of rectangles or
  ellipses.
- Clicking in an existing text object enables the editing of the text.
- Lines are constructed with left click (this adds a new point) and 
  finished with right click.
- Bezier curves are constructed with 4 control
  points. You have to left click 3 times before you can
  finish the curve segment with the right mouse
  button. But you can add more segments by left clicking
  instead of the right button. Sound confusing ? Try it	!
- In addition, there are some new keyboard shortcuts:
  * In the canvas, selected objects can be moved by 
    pressing the cursor keys (big steps) or
    SHIFT+cursor keys (smaller steps).
  * There is a magnetic mode for appending 
    to polylines and bezier curves: Press SHIFT+Left
    Button near the point of line to snap the new line 
    segment to this point.
  * Polylines and bezier curves are closed by SHIFT+Right button.
  * You can cancel selection or line adding with ESC.
