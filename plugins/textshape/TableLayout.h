/**
 * @brief Table layout class.
 *
 * This class is responsible for laying out and drawing QTextTable instances.
 *
 * A full layout is triggered with the layout() function, or from a specific row
 * with the layoutFromRow() function.
 *
 * The table layout has a dirty state which indicates whether a layout is needed
 * This state may be queried using the isDirty() function.
 *
 * It also has a valid state which indicates if the layout is valid or not.
 * This state may be queried using the isValid() function.
 *
 * The table layout may be drawn using a given QPainter with the draw() function.
 *
 * Instances of this class may be reused and the current table can be set using
 * the setTable() function. The table layout caches the internal data objects
 * used for laying out tables.
 *
 * The table layout does not take ownership of the table and it is up to the user
 * of this class to delete the table appropriately.
 *
 * Note that this class does not lay out the content of the table. It just lays out
 * and draws the cell borders et.c. and provides an API to query, and to a certain
 * extent influence, the geometry of the table and its cells. It is up to the user
 * of this class to lay out the content into the cells of the table.
