TableShape Design Notes

A tableshape should be able to be spread over multiple pages

A tableshape's text is contained in a QTextDocument, which can
be shared with other text and table shapes

A tableshape can be nested: tables inside tables are possible

A cell is a shape; if the shape is a text-shape, it can share the QTextDocument with the other cells in the shape and other text and table shapes outside the current table shape.

Every row in a table always has the same number of columns

All cells in a column have the same left-edge position
