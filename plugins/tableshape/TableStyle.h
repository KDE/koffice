/**
 * The table:style-name attribute references a table style, i.e., an <style:style>
 * element of typeâ€œtable. The table style describes the formatting properties of
 * the table, such as width and background color. The table style can be either an
 * automatic or common style.
 *
 * A table style consists of a paragraph style (which contains a frame description)
 * and a width in points.
 *
 * Styles can be nested: the style associated with the table contains the width of a
 * whole table, the style associated with a column the width of that column.
