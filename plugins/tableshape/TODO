                  TODO file for the texttable shape
                  =================================

Datamodel

* should be able to fit all ODF text table data, except for formula's
* does not need to be able to handle MS Word variable column width per row tables

Proof-of-concept read-only table
 * Support small tables with a fixed number of rows and columns
    - Fixed size (table and cells)
    - No split on different pages
 * Render a table on the text shape
 * ODF loading

Make it slightly usable for a viewer (still read-only)
 * Merge cells
    - horizontally
    - vertically
 * Some formatting 

Make it usable for kword (editable)
 * table tool
    - Edit rows/columns
 * ODF saving
