There is work going on the 1.6 branch with Alfredo implementing full MathML support.
His changes will be merged soon.

Martin is working on the trunk for KOffice 2. He redesigns the libraries to make them
ready for the KFormulaShape in KOffice 2. This will be the usual way to work with
formulas. KWord will hold formulas as KFormulaShape and also every other KOffice app
is able to do so.

Further possible features:
- new GUI ( will come )
- updated and improved LaTex filters ( is important )
- filter for Ms equation format ( is it documented? )
- support for different editing ways:
     - WYSIWYG ( the thing we had so far )
     - OpenOffice syntax
     - direct MathMl tree editing
     - direct Latex input
- integration of KFormula with KSpread
