- make load and save working for every element
  -> update test suite
* finish implementation of the TableElement
- implement inheritsAttribute() method in every element class
- finish the scriptLevel implementation in AttributeManager
- solve viewConverter problem in AttributeManager
- implement a AttributeManager test for scriptLevel
* setBaseLIne in TableElement
* rowlines in TableElement
- add defaultAttributevalues to mstyle
*done add PenStyle parsing to mtable element
- solve KoViewConverter issue in AttributeManager, make it always set...
- correct mathspace parsing in operator element.
- implement rendering in all token elements
- make FormulaCursor class able to insert elements
- add functionality to FormulaToolOptions so that user can insert elements
- implement cursor movement with acceptCursor() method

mid term ( potential prerelease ) goals:
- create template files - decide what kind of templates should be in place
- add attribute caching as member variables in elements so that paint()
  does not need a AttributeManager

long term goals:
- add selecting to FormulaCursor class
- iron the loading process out so that it won't crash on errors and report them
