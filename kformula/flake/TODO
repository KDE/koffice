- implement the new tool widget
- implement insertText completly -> some stuff is still missing for glyph elements

- make load and save working for every element
  -> update test suite
- implement inheritsAttribute() method in every element class
- add defaultAttributevalues to mstyle
- correct mathspace parsing in operator element.
- implement rendering in all token elements

mid term ( potential prerelease ) goals:
- create template files - decide what kind of templates should be in place
- add attribute caching as member variables in elements so that paint()
  does not need a AttributeManager

long term goals:
- iron the loading process out so that it won't crash on errors and report them
