/**
 * @short Baseclass for all token elements
 *
 * The MathML specification describes a number of token elements. The classes
 * of these all derive from TokenElement except of mspace. Because of the huge
 * similarity between the token elements loading, saving, painting and layouting
 * code can mostly be shared. This is because token elements hold some text or
 * string that has to be dealt with.
 * The handling of embedded glyphs is also implemented in TokenEa list of the embedded GlyphElements. The TokenElement's QString
 * m_rawString is the string that holds the raw data for the TokenElement. This
 * string contains also QChar that are set to the QChar::ObjectReplacementCharacter
 * category. For rendering these QChar's are replaced with the content of the glyph
 * elements they represent in the raw string.
