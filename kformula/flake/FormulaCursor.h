 * @short The cursor being moved through a formula
 *
 * The FormulaTool instanciates FormulaCursor to move around in the formula and edit
 * it. Each element can implement special cursor behaviour for its children. There
 * are always at least two positions the cursor can have in an element: before and
 * after the element. Only in mrow and some token elements there are more positions
 * possible and in a BasicElement there is only one position. Before the element is
 * position 0, after it position 1 and so on.
 * FormulaTool calls the moveLeft, moveRight, moveUp and moveDown methods. It also
 * sets with setSelection and setWordMovement the further behaviour of the cursor
 * according to the modifiers the user pressed.
 * The FormulaCursor class is also used to save a certain place in the formula. With
 * the currentElement() and position() methods it is possible to act with a special
 * place.
