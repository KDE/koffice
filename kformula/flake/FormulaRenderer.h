/**
 * @short FormulaRenderer takes care of painting and layouting the elements
 *
 * FormulaRenderer follows the visitor pattern. It iterates through the element
 * tree and calls layout() or paint() methods to let the single elements layout
 * or paint itsselves. This more generic approach allows more efficient repainting
 * and relayouting.
 * The update() method is the most interesting of the class as it is used to update
 * the visuals when the formula tree has changed somehow. The method calls
 * layoutElement() and then paintElement(). The former is made to be efficient so it
 * layouts only as many parental elements as needed.
 * Using a central class for painting parts or the whole tree structure that makes
 * up a formula has several advantages. First it reduces a lot of code duplication.
 * Second it takes care of painting and layouting in the right order so that there
 * no need anymore for the single element classes to do so. Third we can control 
 * instance AttributeManager and destroying and constructing it often is not needed
 * anymore.
