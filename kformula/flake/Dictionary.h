 * @short Dictionary to look up operator attributes and entity mappings

 * In section 3.2.5.2 of the MathML spec the numerous attributes for the mo element are
 * described. Further in section 3.2.5.7 the spec states that a MathML renderer should
 * have a dictionary to look up those attributes values. This class implements such a
 * dictionary by a script generated source file.
 * It also implements a lookup method for entities as MathML allows a number of them.
 * The method mapEntity maps a given "&...;" representation to the corresponding QChar.
