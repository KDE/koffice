/**
 * @short manages all the attributes, used by the elements to obtain attribute values
 *
 * The AttributeManager is the central point dealing with the MathML attributes and
 * their values. It is in fact something like a StyleManager. As the normal elements
 * only have a general hash list of the elements they hold, there is the need for a
 * class that manages conversion and heritage of the attributes during the painting
 * phase. These are the two main tasks of AttributeManager.
 * The AttributeManager is always called when an element needs a value to work with.
 * The AttributeManager looks for that value first in the asking element's own
 * attribute list. If nothing is found the AttributeManager looks for a parent element
 * that might inherit the right value. If AttributeManager has no success again it
 * returns the default value for that attribute.
