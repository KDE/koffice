This is NOT compiled.
Formulas are now handled by that library, not by a part anymore.

According to Andrea Rizzi, here is the plan:
"I think that libkformula is better if it is light and fast so that programs
like kplot could use it. But in libkformula there's no need for
chemical equation support or other thing like this.
In kformula(koffice) I want to put everything that should be written in a
scientific book. Now I have no time to develop this but starting from
August (to December) I have time to code."
