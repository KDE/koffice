=====================

I have to add more I have implemented or plan to do it.   ;-)

Selecting widgets:
------------------

If no widget is selected the left mouse button (LMK) or LMB+Shift
makes the widget under the mouse (WUM) primary selected.

If another widget is primary and there are no secondaries LMB
makes WUM primary. All other widgets are made unselected. LMB+Shift
makes WUM secondary.

If WUM is secondary, LMB makes it primary, all other are unselected.
If WUM is secondary, LMB+Shift unselects it.

if WUM is primary, LMB does nothing. (Holding down LMB moves widget)
if WUM is primary, LMB+Shift unselects all widgets.
