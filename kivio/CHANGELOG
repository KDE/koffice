    - Created this file
    - Saving/Loading connections now works
    - Paste now pastes at +10 pixels to the left and down
    - Group/Ungroup preserves connections
    - Double clicking as stencil's icon in the dock now adds a new stencil
      to the page at (0,0)
    - Deleting a stencil with multiple connections now properly disconnects
      the connections and doesn't leave dangling targets.
    - With multiple StraightConnectors selected, dragging an endpoint no
      longer drags *aLL* their endpoints.
    - Added a 'lineJoin' type to the KivioPainter object with the default
      type of "RoundJoin".  Need to make it use this in the PS painter.

    - Added Text Tool.

(Dave Marotti)
10/27/2000
    - Fixed some group stencil bugs.  Text properties were not passed along
      to the grouped stencils.

(Dave Marotti)
10/29/2000
    - Moved all text properties from KivioShapeData to KivioTextShapeData and
      created a pointer to them inside KivioShapeData.  This should cut down
      on the memory needed for each shape since most shapes don't care about
      text/text-alignment/etc...
    - Changed the way KivioConnectorTargets look now.  They are blue x's
      outlined in white.  They are alot easier to see on dark backgrounds now.
      They are also drawn as pixmaps, not as lines.
    - Cancel works on stencil text dialogs now

(Max Judin)
10/31/2000
    - Added connector tool.
	
(Dave Marotti)
10/31/2000
    - Added LICENSE file, and inserted GPL statements into the front of every
      source code file.
    - Changed the order in which stencil pieces get drawn.  Now they draw in
      this order: stencil, targets, resize-handles.  This way, connections
      show through properly and are not obfuscated by targets.

(Dave Marotti)
11/12/2000
    - Added a right-mouse-button menu to the select and zoom tools.

(Max Judin)
11/13/2000
    - Moved coloractions to the tklib.
    - Added findTool() to ToolController so one tool can set focus to another
      tool.

(Dave Marotti)
11/13/2000
    - Double clicking a stencil with the select tool now allows you to edit
      the stencil's text.
    - Changed TextController::toolSelected() to selectTool().

(Dave Marotti)
11/18/2000
    - Added KivioBaseConnector stencil to make it easier to create connector
      stencils (plugin style).
      
(Dave Marotti)
11/19/2000
    - Added KivioRect class.  Similar to QRect, but with floating point values.
    - Added KivioStencil::rect() for getting the geometry of a stencil in one
      call.
    - Removed the size and position actions from the toolbar.  They now resize
      in a dock window.  View->Stencil Geometry Panel will show it.
    - Implemented snap to grid for dragging and resizing.

(Max Judin)
11/20/2000
    - Made geometry panel update the units when the rulers changed units.

(Dave Marotti)
11/20/2000
    - Made the default grid color a bit lighter.  Changed snap to grid, and
      show grid to true by default.  Made the default snap to grid units
      10.0 and 10.0.

(Max Judin)
11/2?/2000
    - Implemented zoom-selected and zoom-all.
	- Start working on configuration dialog.

(Dave Marotti)
11/24/2000
    - Added insert/remove/toggle-visiblity/toggle connectivity to the layers
	  panel.
	- Added QPrinter printing.  Everything prints, but curves aren't true
	  curves.

(Dave Marotti)
11/25/2000
    - Added move-layer-up and move-layer-down.
	- Fixed insertion order of layers in layer-panel.
	- Added snap-to-grid while drawing a new connector.

(Dave Marotti)
11/26/2000
    - Added KivioLineStyle and KivioTextStyle.

(Max Judin)
11/??/2000
    - Changed pixmaps in layer dock

(Dave Marotti / David Faure)
11/26/2000 - 12/15/2000
    - Made the move to the KDE CVS and a few things were re-arranged.
    - Removed many warnings
    - #include'd moc files instead of compiling them separately
    - Changed all debug() statements to kDebug << etc...
    - Makefile overhaul
    - A few changes to the way saving and loading is handled in KivioBaseTargetStencil
    - Added a parameter to drawContent() of the doc and page classes so you could
      choose if you wanted targets and selection handles drawn.  This allows the
      bird's eye view to be a bit more usable without those x's in the way.

(Dave Marotti)
12/17/2000
    - Fixed unselect-but where clicking on an area without a stencil would
      select random stencils.
    - Placed the common primary'sh colors in the front of the color action widgets
      and added a grayscale gradient of colors. Capitalized all color names.
    - Implemented snap-to-guides
    - Fixed the stencils which went out of their bounding-boxes, now they don't.

(Max Judin)
12/25/2000
    - Implemented an options dialog.

(Dave Marotti)
12/25/2000
    - Damn I suck, working on Christmas :(  Oh well, gotta do something while the
      food is cooking.
    - Created a new base stencils type, Kivio1DStencil, which can be used to make
      connector stencils which need width.  It is going to deprecate
      KivioBaseConnectorStencil and I will remove that class in the future.
    - Made KivioBaseTargetStencil easier to use.
    - Added tkmath.h.  It contains vector functions and classes and a few other
      math related functions like a line-collision detection routine which allows
      for a threshold.
    - Modified straight_connector to use Kivio1DStencil as it's parent class.
    - Unified the handle drawing code.  Now it's part of the KivioPainter classes.
      Start points are drawn with a plus in the box, endpoints are drawn with an
      x in the box, connectable points are drawn with a smaller box inside the
      box, and others are just plain green. When connected, they turn red.

    - The wheel-event now causes the page to move up and down instead of zooming
      in and out.

(Dave Marotti)
01/14/2001
    - Started work on the protection dialog box
    - Deletion protection works

(Dave Marotti)
01/18/2001
    - Width/Height protection now works.
    - Little pictures of padlocks are now drawn in place of resize handles when
      protected.
      
(Dave Marotti)
01/23/2001
    - Width/height/x/y/deletion protection works, there are some flaws though.
      If you protect something, then group it, things can act funny when you
      move or resize the group.

(Dave Marotti)
02/04/2001
    - Below 50% zoom, the targets are no longer drawn
    - Added a text handle to connector stencils

(Dave Marotti)
02/27/2001
    - Starting a connector now snaps to nearby connector targets
    - Zooming out with the minus-zoom tool now works more than once
    - Parts of exporting to a file (gif/jpeg/etc) now work
    - Printing now abides by visible layers

(Dave Marotti)
03/06/2001
    - All but the crop abilities of export page work
    - Made the moving of already selected stencils a bit more 'user friendly.'

(Dave Marotti)
03/15/2001
    - A slightly updated method of saving/loading stencils and files has been
      implemented.  Now ID's are used for stencils and sets instead of the
      name.  This will hopefully fix any internationalization issues when
      loading Kivio files which were created in a different locale. On the
      downside, this made all previous save files incompatible.  I know this
      sucks, but it was necessary and writing a converter at this point in time
      is something I don't have time to do.

(Dave Marotti)
03/18/2001
    - Modified the way the SML file format is.  The text="" and html="" tags
      are no longer valid for the textbox shape.  Instead, a KivioTextStyle
      tag should be nested under the KivioShape tag to specify the font,
      text, color, style, etc...
    - All SML files were updated to reflect this.
    - The kivioconnector tool and kiviotexttools were fixed to find
      the correct stencil in the internal list of spawners.
