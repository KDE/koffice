+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Kivio is a flowcharting package for KDE which is incorporated into KOffice. It
is heavily based off of Queesio, which was originally developed by Dave Marotti.
All development on Queesio has been halted and all work is now being done on
Kivio in a cooperative fasion by Dave Marotti and theKompany.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
There are three methods of installation: binary, standalone source, and koffice 
source.

Method 1 - Binary:
Obtain one of the binary packages from theKompany's website and install it. More
information is available on the website (see bottom of this file).

Method 2 - Standalone Source:
Obtain the source tarball from theKompany's website and untar it.  Build it with
./configure ; make ; make install

Method 3 - KOffice Source:
Obtain the source tarball from a KDE mirror and untar it.  Follow the
instructions for compiling KOffice.  Kivio will be compiled and installed along
with KOffice.

Method 4 - KOffice CVS:
This is the bleeding edge version of Kivio and I make no guarantees about it's
compatibility, stability, or usability.
Go to the KOffice website for more information about obtaining a CVS copy of
Kivio.

You should now be ready to run kivio.  The executable name is 'kivio.' It might
even be added to one of your KDE menus if you installed it from KOffice.
