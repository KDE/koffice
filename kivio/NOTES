This file is just for miscellaneous notes on how things work in Kivio.


- Removing a stencil set by clicking on the button 'x'.  There are quite
  a few things which happen as a result of a user clicking the 'x' on
  a DragBarButton.
  DragBarButton emits a closeRequired( DragBarButton * ) signal,
  KivioStackBar catches it with slotDeleteButton( DragBarButton * ),
  KivioStackBar then emits deleteButton(DragBarButton *, QWidget *, KivioStackBar *),
  KivioDocument then catches this with slotDeleteStencilSet( signature ) and
    iterates through all stencils on all pages of the document making sure it
	is ok to delete this stencil set.  If it is, it removes the stencil (spawner) set
	with a call to removeSpawnerSet( ... ) and emits the signal
	sig_deleteStencilSet( DragBarButton *, QWidget *, KivioStackBar * )
  StencilBarDockManager catches this with slotDeleteStencilSet( .... ) and tells the
    KivioStackBar object to delete the passed DragBarButton and widget associated with
	it.  It then checks if any pages are visible on the KivioStackBar object.  If
	there are not, it then removes it from either the bars list, or topLevel bars list
	and then deletes the KivioStackBar object.
