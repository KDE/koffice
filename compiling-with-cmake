Compiling KOffice Trunk

KOffice compiles using kdelibs trunk.
An explenation on how to install that and its dependencies is
updated regularly on:

http://wiki.kde.org/tiki-index.php?page=KDE3To4

After you followed that you should be more familiar with KDE4 and CMake
development.
There is one more dependency for koffice that is kdepimlibs, which is
in svn at:
    svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/KDE/kdepimlibs

Next you can start your compile of KOffice just like you have done
with the above two libraries.
