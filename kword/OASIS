Notes about the use of the OASIS format in kword:
-------------------------------------------------

* Tables
In OASIS, tables are treated like paragraphs.
In KWord, tables are either "inline as character" or "at a fixed position".
This gives three cases:
  + inline table, alone in its paragraph -> can be saved the OASIS way.
  + inline table with other things in the paragraph -> wrapper frame+textbox needed
       The wrapper frame is marked with a koffice-specific attribute, koffice:is-wrapper-frame="true".
       Upon loading, the wrapper textbox is removed if it doesn't contain anything else.
  + fixed-position table -> wrapper frame+textbox would be needed here too.
       But anyway those tables are very difficult to handle, and offer nothing
       compared to "putting an inline table in a non-inline textbox", so I have disabled them.

* Frame behavior on new pages
KWord supports "What happens on new page: create a new frame and reconnect, no followup, make copy."
OASIS doesn't, but this doesn't matter, it doesn't affect rendering of existing documents, only editing.
So we save this with a koffice:frame-behavior-on-new-page attribute, possible values:
followup, copy or none. Default value: copy for header/footers, none otherwise.

* DTP
KWord supports both the normal word processing (paragraphs directly inside the body)
and the page-based DTP mode (page-sequence element).

Notes about interoperability with OpenOffice.org-2.0:
-----------------------------------------------------

List of bugs in OOo-1.9.87 affecting interoperability:
 - <text:notes-configuration text:note-class="footnote"...> has text:start-value="0", and is ignored on loading (private mail sent)
 - style:text-underline-type="single" is missing for underlined text, only style is specified (mail sent to OASIS TC)
 - DTP mode not really supported; but even with single page, frames are misplaced (private mail sent)

List of features that KWord has, but OOo doesn't have, and which are in the OASIS standard:
 - OOo doesn't load nor save the cursor-position processing instruction 
 - DTP mode (page-sequence)
 - frame break (we model it with fo:break-after="column" in the paragraph style)
 - copy-frames (probably)
 - hyphenation bool as character property, for more control (probably)
 - diagonal lines in table cells (probably)
 - line style for footnote separator (probably)
 - table templates (probably)
 - DTP mode using the draw:page element (probably)
 - (after 1.0) border around a word or any run of text (probably)

Differences in rendering:
 - In KWord endnotes are right under the end of the text; in OOo they are on a separate page.
