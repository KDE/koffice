Notes about the use of the OASIS format in kword:

* Tables
In OASIS, tables are treated like paragraphs.
In KWord, tables are either "inline as character" or "at a fixed position".
This gives three cases:
  + inline table, alone in its paragraph -> can be saved the OASIS way.
  + inline table with other things in the paragraph -> wrapper frame+textbox needed
  + fixed-position table -> wrapper frame+textbox needed
The wrapper frame is marked with a koffice-specific attribute, koffice:is-wrapper-frame="true".
Upon loading, the wrapper textbox is removed if it doesn't contain anything else.
