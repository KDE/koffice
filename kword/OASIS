Notes about the use of the OASIS format in kword:

* Tables
In OASIS, tables are treated like paragraphs.
In KWord, tables are either "inline as character" or "at a fixed position".
This gives three cases:
  + inline table, alone in its paragraph -> can be saved the OASIS way.
  + inline table with other things in the paragraph -> wrapper frame+textbox needed
       The wrapper frame is marked with a koffice-specific attribute, koffice:is-wrapper-frame="true".
       Upon loading, the wrapper textbox is removed if it doesn't contain anything else.
  + fixed-position table -> wrapper frame+textbox would be needed here too.
       But anyway those tables are very difficult to handle, and offer nothing
       compared to "putting an inline table in a non-inline textbox", so I have disabled them.

* Frame behavior on new pages
KWord supports "What happens on new page: create a new frame and reconnect, no followup, make copy.
OASIS doesn't, but this doesn't matter, it doesn't affect rendering of existing documents, only editing.
So we save this with a koffice:frame-behavior-on-new-page attribute, possible values:
followup, copy or none. Default value: copy for header/footers, none otherwise.
