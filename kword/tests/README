When running oasis-kword.sh you can expect the following differences in the diff,
they are not bugs:

* Background color (bkRed/bkBlue/bkGreen) isn't saved anymore for transparent frames (bkStyle=0)
  (which makes sense since it doesn't appear)

* Font weight is rounded to a multiple of 10 (if not 75)
  -    <WEIGHT value="48" />
  +    <WEIGHT value="40" />
No idea how I ended up with a value of 48 in the old .kwd file, Qt mostly knows 50 and 75.

* Picture collection: the keys and filenames are re-generated.

* The direction of a paragraph and its text color are now explicit instead of implicit:
     <LAYOUT>
      <NAME value="Standard" />
-     <FLOW align="left" />
+     <FLOW dir="L" align="left" />
      <FORMAT id="1" pos="0" len="26" >
       <WEIGHT value="50" />
+      <COLOR blue="0" red="0" green="0" />
       <FONT name="Bitstream Vera Sans" />
       <SIZE value="9" />
       <ITALIC value="0" />
 This is hidden by oasis-kword.sh though.
