TODO-List:
----------

- Tab in the parag layout dialog for configuration of tabulators (adding/deleting/modifying them)
- Preview widget for numbering
- Preview widget for style templates editor
- Make recalculation of frames (after resizing frames) and calculation of text running around frames much FASTER. Espacially the
  recalculation of the whole text in these cases is very slow in long docs
