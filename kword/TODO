TODO-List:
----------

Missing or incomplete stuff:
----------------------------------------
- Tab in the parag layout dialog for configuration of tabulators (adding/deleting/modifying them)
- Preview widget for numbering
- Preview widget for style templates editor
- Tabulators don't work correctly in "Blocksatz"
- Table configuration dialog

Optimations:
----------------------------------------
- Make recalculation of frames (after resizing frames) and calculation of text running around frames much FASTER. Espacially the
  recalculation of the whole text in these cases is very slow in long docs

Bugs to fix:
----------------------------------------
- When deleting text, empty pages (frames) are not removed
- Tables have to be in the textflow of the first frameset (some hack needed here)
- Do not allow to make frames too small as this can result in an endless loop
- When moving/resizing tables and the go over multiple pages there are some redraw problems - but nothing really bad :-))
- When a frame grows there are sometimes redraw errors
- When removing text in a table cell shrink table cells

More bugs:
- Deleting the first frameset crashes kword (can only be done in DTP)_
- new page is not shown after a 'addpage'
- Add getSelectedFrame() to kword_page and replace lots of code with that function.
- Page Preview image forgets about orientation when changing page size. (always shows  portrait)
- deleting pictures-frames should also delete the picture (from the tar) (imageCollection)



Add lots of functions to the framedia.cc as a placeholder for future extentions.
  - SheetSide still has to go in.

Add functionality:
- Even/odd pages
- 'copy-frame' behaviour
- Sideheads
- split frame
- only show frame on [odd|even] pages
- copy past of picture frames

Look into:
- placing files external 
  at the moment a file is created to fit the origional file. This can be used as a 
  thumb..
- books 
  (where there is more then one Kword doc in a book, but they share styletags 
   and pagenumbers)

Find out if this is done correctly:
  CMYK images are read
  CMYK images are printed
  fonts are included on print
  strange fonts are also included
