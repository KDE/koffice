TODO-List
=========

Bugs:
-----
- anything that http://bugs.kde.org mentions ;)

Differences with OO that ought to be fixed:
-------------------------------------------
- space above and below paragraphs is QMAX()ed indeed, like QRichText originally did.
- offsetFromBaseline should be a % (of the font size) instead of an absolute pt value,
  even in the GUI (which currently limits to +/- 9pt).

Missing or incomplete stuff:
----------------------------
- Even/odd pages
 - Add SheetSide config in framedia 
- Tables should get a title (with positioning posibility)
  This will basicly be a new frame placed on top or at bottom of table.
  And it shouldn't be limited to tables - any frame could get that.

Other missing features:

Sideheads (for text)
Split frames needs to be implemented.
Styles have to be saved external (and/or an import/export facility).
Books (collection of documents) should be implemented
Implement complete DCOP interface
Make everything scriptable
Add "TopOfFrame"-TopOfPage" etc to styles.


- It should be possible to keep files and shapes external. Kword should also
notice a changed file (preferably at runtime) and reload it.

Add a RMB option on a copy-frame to update position of all copies in that FS.
Add RMB option on text to copy current format to a (new) style. Including tab positions..

- picture insertion point when pasting should be as an inline frame. Using default placing methods.
- cut/paste of images do not work across documents (also in bugs.kde.org)
- auto-update TOC before printing, so no doc is printed with an out-of-date TOC. It might alter the layout, ok, but an out-of-date TOC is just a waste of paper (besides being misleading...)
- interaction with frame breaks are a bit strange. How do you remove it? You cannot select it, nor can you use backspace or del..
- when writing bulks of text, when the cursor gets to the border of the window, it should not only scroll 1 line (to make sure the cursor stays in the visible portion of the document) but should be moved to the center of the window (like in emacs:-). So the average position of the cursor is the center of the window, rather than the bollom line.
