TODO-List
=========

Bugs:
-----
- textformatter: need to check for line-level breaking during the formatting of each line
Currently we do it afterwards, so if the margins differ, where the line ends up, we can't notice.
- solve problem with a change in the available width right in the middle of the
character we're trying to place (e.g. and it needs to move down to where the width is bigger)
Possible solution: let getMargins return a "valid for a height of ... only",
and then kotextformatter needs to move down by that height if .... hmm done.
- footnotes: check move to next page, endnotes
- anything else that http://bugs.kde.org mentions ;)

Differences with OO that ought to be fixed:
-------------------------------------------
- space above and below paragraphs is QMAX()ed indeed, like QRichText originally did.
- offsetFromBaseline should be a % (of the font size) instead of an absolute pt value,
  even in the GUI (which currently limits to +/- 9pt).

Missing or incomplete stuff:
----------------------------
- Even/odd pages
 - Add SheetSide config in framedia 
- Tables should get a title (with positioning posibility)
  This will basicly be a new frame placed on top or at bottom of table.
  And it shouldn't be limited to tables - any frame could get that.

Other missing features:

Sideheads (for text)
Split frames needs to be implemented.
Styles have to be saved external (and/or an import/export facility).
Books (collection of documents) should be implemented
Implement complete DCOP interface
Make everything scriptable
Add "TopOfFrame"-TopOfPage" etc to styles.
add "Keep this parag with the next/prev" options to styles.


External files:
--------------
Included files (pictures/parts/formula's)
- It should be possible to keep files external. Kword should also notice a changed file
  (preferably at runtime) and reload it.

OK-ing the stylist seems to apply style change to all styles, not just the changed ones...

Add a RMB option on a copy-frame to update position of all copies in that FS.
Add RMB option on text to copy current format to a (new) style. Including tab positions..

- picture insertion point when pasting should be as an inline frame. Using default placing methods.
- cut/paste of images do not work across documents (also in bugs.kde.org)
- auto-update TOC before printing, so no doc is printed with an out-of-date TOC. It might alter the layout, ok, but an out-of-date TOC is just a waste of paper (besides being misleading...)
- interaction with frame breaks are a bit strange. How do you remove it? You cannot select it, nor can you use backspace or del..
- one should be able to introduce dependencies between styles, so if I want to change the general font of the text, I do not have to modify all the styles.
- when writing bulks of text, when the cursor gets to the border of the window, it should not only scroll 1 line (to make sure the cursor stays in the visible portion of the document) but should be moved to the center of the window (like in emacs:-). So the average position of the cursor is the center of the window, rather than the bollom line.

- interaction with KoParts is somehow strange. Especially positioning them in the document, as the size when using the handles is not the same as the end product. But I am not used to it in the Windows world either...
  This is due to the problemsn that we don't zoom and dont allow easy moving in the parts. A square which representst the whole placed document when moving just the little screen would be nice.
