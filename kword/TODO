TODO-List:
----------

Missing or incomplete stuff:
----------------------------------------
- Tab in the parag layout dialog for configuration of tabulators (adding/deleting/modifying them)
- Preview widget for numbering
- Preview widget for style templates editor
- Tabulators don't work correctly in "Blocksatz"
- Table configuration dialog

Optimations:
----------------------------------------
- Make recalculation of frames (after resizing frames) and calculation of text running around frames much FASTER. Espacially the
  recalculation of the whole text in these cases is very slow in long docs

Bugs to fix:
----------------------------------------
- When pasting text the cursor is not set correctly
- When deleting text, empty pages (frames) are not removed
- Selection text with the mouse is fucked up (and fuckes up the text easily :-)
- Tables have to be in the textflow of the first frameset (some hack needed here)
- Do not allow to make frames too small as this can result in an endless loop
- When moving/resizing tables and the go over multiple pages there are some redraw problems - but nothing really bad :-))
- When a frame grows there are sometimes redraw errors
- When removing text in a table cell shrink table cells

Add lots of functions to the framedia.cc as a placeholder for future extentions.

Look into:
 - placing files external
 - books 
    (where there is more then one Kword doc in a book, but they share styletags 
    and pagenumbers)
- Even uneven pages must be corrected to work.

Find out if this is done correctly:
  CMYK images are read
  CMYK images are printed
  Picture previews created and the file is saved unmodified
  deleting pictures-frames deletes the picture
  fonts are included on print
  strange fonts are also included

  copy/past of a picture frame copies only reference
  delete of second picture doesn't delete file

Add getSelectedFrame() to kword_page and replace lots of code with that function.

Page Preview image forgets about orientation when changing page size. (always shows
portraid)

New frameset suggests "Frameset 9" and higher. Think of a nice way to start with 1

Features:
  - split frame
  - only show frame on [odd|even] pages
