Overall design
==============

* The document (KWDocument) has a list of framesets (KWFrameSet)

* Framesets include: text frameset, picture/clipart frameset, table frameset etc.

* A frameset has a list of frames, KWFrame. A KWFrame is basically a rectangle
(KoRect) with a bunch of attributes. 
The frameset contains the contents, like the text or a picture.
The frames visualize the contents of the frameset. 
Imagine a 10 pages document, with 1 text-frameset and 10 frames, because our
example author wants to have one frame per page.  This means that there is one 
text, and the frames define where on the pages this text is displayed.

* About text framesets: they hold a text document (KWTextDocument, which is
a QTextDocument from the QRichText classes - more on QRT later).

* About Tables; one table is a KWTableFrameset. This tableframeset contains
all the cells as its frames. But because the cells have a different text per
cell, we contain the cells in their own KWTextFrameset.

   KWTableFrameSet
    |           |
    |        TextFrames
  Cells               +----------+
     +--+                        |
        | ---> KWTextFrameSet    |
        |          +-> KWFrame <-+
        |                        |
        | ---> KWTextFrameSet    |
        |          +-> KWFrame <-+
        |                        |
        + ---> KWTextFrameSet    |
                   +-> KWFrame <-+

* The z-order of the frames (i.e. which one is on top of which)
is defined by m_zOrder in KWFrame. This number is relative to the other
frames *on the same page*.

Editing
=======
To edit the contents of a text frameset (including table cells), the user clicks on it.
This creates an edit object for the frameset, which will be destroyed as soon as we go
edit another frameset. This means, in a given view (canvas), there is only one edit
object at a given moment (for text objects, it's the one with the cursor).
There is one type of edit object per type of frameset. For instance: KWTextFrameSetEdit.

Custom items
============
A custom item is anything (like an inline frame, a variable etc.) that
is treated as a special character. QTextCustomItem is the base class for
it, we have KoTextCustomItem in kotext.

Inline frames are one kind of custom item. The frame (and its englobing
frameset) exist as usual, but a KWAnchor instance is created, inserted
into the text, and linked to the frame. The anchor always has the same size
as the frame. When the text is flowed, the anchor is positioned, it tells
the frame to move to the new position.

Painting
========
Here's how the painting (drawing the stuff on screen, and on printer) works:
Each frameset is responsible for drawing itself. The base class, KWFrameSet,
handles the generic code for iterating through the frames, applying the
"frame is a copy" stuff, drawing the borders, etc. So each specific frameset
class only has to implement drawFrame (exception for KWTableFrameset though).

Painting of text: KWTextFrameset paints the text for each frame, calling
KoTextDocument::drawWYSIWYG (with flags for "only the changed paragraphs" etc).
When printing this method delegates to drawWithoutDoubleBuffer.
Both methods iterate through the paragraphs, and call drawParagWYSIWYG for each
one to be redrawn. This method implements the double-buffering, paints the
background color and the space on the right of the paragraph, and calls
QTextParag::paint(). Its role is to draw series of characters with the same
formatting at once (in one go). For each set of chars to be painted,
KoTextParag::drawParagString is called.

In short:
KWFrame::drawContents -> KWTextFrameSet::drawFrame
 -> KoTextDocument::drawWYSIWYG -> KoTextDocument::drawParagWYSIWYG
 -> KoTextParag::paint -> KoTextParag::drawParagString -> KoTextParag::drawParagStringInternal

The cursor is also drawn by KoTextParag::paint, which calls KoTextParag::drawCursor.
The blinking cursor is implemented in KoTextView, which calls a virtual
drawCursor() method, implemented in KWTextFrameSetEdit.

More low-level things
=====================
.. such as coordinate systems, font sizes, justified spaces etc.

Wow, you managed to read this until the end ? Good. "GOTO 10" now ;)
