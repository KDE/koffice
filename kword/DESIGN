Coordinate systems
==================
 
Just a quick note, to be expanded later.
 
Document (pt values, in double, KoPoint, KoRect.)
 |
 |--KWDocument::zoom*
 |
Zoomed coordinates (pixel values, in int, QPoint, QRect) 
This is also called the "Normal" coordinate system.
 |         |
 |         |--KWViewMode::normalToView
 |         V
 |    View Mode (pixels values, but e.g. pages are re-arranged)
 |    That's also the KWCanvas (scrollview)'s contents coordinates.
 |
 |
 |
 | And for text framesets, there's also :
 |
 |--KWTextFrameSet::contentsToInternal
 V
Internal coordinates (pixel values for QRT)
 
This last transformation doesn't depend on the view-mode arrangement,
it's only about going from the frameset coord to the qrt internal coord,
both being "one page below another".
