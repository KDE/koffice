Coordinate systems
==================

Just a quick note, to be expanded later.

Document (pt values, in double)
        |
        | KWViewMode::normalToView
        V
View Mode (still pt values, in double)
        |
        | KWDocument::zoom*
        V
Zoom (pixel value, in int)
That's also the KWCanvas (scrollview)'s contents coordinates.
And for text framesets, there's also :
        |
        | KWTextFrameSet::contentsToInternal
        V
Internal coordinates (pixel values for QRT)
