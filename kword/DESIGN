Overall design
==============

* The document (KWDocument) has a list of framesets (KWFrameSet)
Currently the order of the framesets in the list defines the z-order (which frameset
is on top of which one), but this ought to be changed after 1.1 (with an int in the 
frameset for instance)

* Framesets include: text frameset, picture/clipart frameset, table frameset etc.

* A frameset has a list of frames, KWFrame. A KWFrame is basically a rectangle
(KoRect) with a bunch of attributes. The data is NOT in the frame, but in the frameset.
The frames are just the way to visualize the contents of the frameset. Imagine a
10 pages document, with 1 text frameset and 10 frames, one per page: the frames
hold no data.

* About text framesets: they hold a text document (KWTextDocument, which is
a QTextDocument from the QRichText classes - more on QRT later).

Coordinate systems
==================
 
Just a quick note, to be expanded later.
 
Document (pt values, in double, KoPoint, KoRect.)
 |
 |--KWDocument::zoom*
 |
Zoomed coordinates (pixel values, in int, QPoint, QRect) 
This is also called the "Normal" coordinate system.
 |         |
 |         |--KWViewMode::normalToView
 |         V
 |    View Mode (pixels values, but e.g. pages are re-arranged)
 |    That's also the KWCanvas (scrollview)'s contents coordinates.
 |
 |
 |
 | And for text framesets, there's also :
 |
 |--KWTextFrameSet::normalToInternal
 V
Internal coordinates (pixel values for QRT)
 
This last transformation doesn't depend on the view-mode arrangement,
it's only about going from the frameset coord to the qrt internal coord,
both being "one page below another".
