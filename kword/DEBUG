Tips for developers
===================

KWord has a few hidden keys (aka easter-eggs :) that help debugging it,
without the need for menuitems to be removed before releasing.

The current debug keys are:

Ctrl-Shift-F : Frames debug. Outputs information about all existing frames.
Ctrl-Shift-P : Paragraphs debug. Outputs information about all paragraphs of the current frameset.
Ctrl-Shift-V : Verbose parag debug. Includes formatting of each character.
