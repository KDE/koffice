This is a TODO list for things that are left to be done for KOffice2.0

Make a config dialog again.
  We need to investigate how many options still really are configurable and
  not blindly reinstate what was there.

Port actions
  KWView has a big list of actions still commented out, most of which
  either should be added there again, or should be added in the text shape.

End notes.
  We want them, there is not much for them yet. (only some code in frames/KWFrameLayout)
  Note that footnotes are now in the text-shape. End notes should be done using frames, though.

Add action;  remove/detach outline

export number of pictures and number of tables to the canvasresource

Finish page delete command
 * delete all frames that are _on_ the page (instead of not moving them)

Finish statistics dialog
    * selected text.
    * code to determine the amount of words/syllables.

Finish page insert command
    In the redo a frame may be created due to going from a normal to a page-spread.
    This frame should be deleted in the undo again.

Make shape manipulations undo-able
    If I alter options in the edit frameset dialog those are not done by actions.
    Maybe this requires reverting commit 692305.

(re)create an insert-text frame menu option.  Similar to the one we had in 1.x
So people can use that instead of the shape-selector.
