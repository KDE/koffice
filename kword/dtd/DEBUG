How to debug KWord's DTD?

You can debug this DTD with xmllint (from libxml2)
But before you have to prepare the ungzipped, untarred KWord file (let's call the file maindoc.xml)

You have to replace:
    <!DOCTYPE DOC>
by
    <!DOCTYPE DOC SYSTEM "file:/the-path-to-this-DTD/kword.dtd">

Then you can do:
    xmllint --valid maindoc.xml
