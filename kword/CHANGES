Reggie, 9.9.1998:
-----------------
- Attributes for writing text can be set with the
  toolbar now. So it's possible to write with defferent
  attributes now.
  I only miss the attribute 'underlined' in KWFormat! 
  I'll implement that.
- The attributes, which are shown in the toolbar, are
  automatically updated when moving the cursor.
- There were lots of bugs with calculating the correct font
  width/height when typing characters and moving the cursor.
  I fixed lots of problems here, but I'm sure there are still
  some more. Especially with KWFormatContext::apply() the
  displayFont and the (max)Ascents/(max)Descents were not
  updated. I fixed that.
- I also fixed a bug when breaking lines, so that the cursor
  is placed correctly if it jumps to the next line.
- Fixed a redraw bug.
- Fixed a problem in KWDisplayFont.

Reggie, 10.9.1998:
------------------
- Introduced font attribute UNDERLINE.
- Implemented 'bool KWString::remove(unsigned int _pos,unsigned int _len)', 
  'void KWString::append(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len) and 
  'KWChar* KWString::copy(KWChar *_data,unsigned int _len)'
- Implemented 'bool KWParag::deleteText(pos,len)', 
  'void KWParag::appendText(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len)'.

Reggie, 11.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented Key_Delete and Key_Backspace, and everything which 
  was needed for that. There are still lots of problems with that,
  especially with placing the cursor and redrawing.
- Implemented Key_Return (== Key_Enter). It seems to work ok, but I'm sure
  that there are also some problems in it (the same as for Key_Delete and
  Key_Backspace). That's because I'm still not totally fimilar with the
  KWFormatContext. So, Torben, please look at the new implemented
  KeyPressEvents and fix the stuff which I did wrong :-))
- Fixed a bug in "Blocksatz" (avoided division by zero if there are no
  spaces in a line).
- Fixed a bug in freeChar().
- There are bigger problems with alignment center and right. The width of
  a line is not calculated correctly - we have to find a way to do that
  quite fast _and_ correctly.

Reggie, 13.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented KWFormatCollection, and it's already working

  work on the implementation of CENTER and RIGHT, this is really
  broken at the moment...

Reggie, 16.10.1998 - 19.10.1998
-------------------------------
- Made KWord frame orientated instead of page orientated - these were _BIG_ changes
- Everything which worked before the page-orientation -> frame-orientation changes, works again now
- Implemented templates
- Started implementation of printing (at the moment, only the dialog opens :-)
- Fixed lots of speed problems in KWFormatContext when editing long textes. It was terribly slow.
  But it's possible that I introduced some bugs - if this is the case I'll, of course, fix them :-)
  What I did: KWFormatContext::init(..) is called quite often when navigating with the cursor (e.g
  a line up, deleting/inserting text, etc.). 
  The implementation of this init methode started at the first parag of the text and went through
  _all_ paragraphs, until the needed one was reached. For long textes (I tested with 70 pages) this was
  damn slow when you were nearly at the end of the text. Now init doesn't go through all parags anymore
  if it is not really needed (and it is nearly never needed!). So this is much faster now.

- Started writing a dialog for configuring frames and framesets. Currently
  it's possible to set the text run-around type for frames and the above
