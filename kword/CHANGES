Main changes between KWord-0.8 (KOffice-1.0) and KWord-1.1-beta1
========================================================================

New overall design and new formatting engine.

Better zooming; adapts to the DPI settings (of the screen and of the printer)
This means, if your X server is correctly configured, the page on screen has
the same size as the real paper page.

Much better performance with huge documents (the text is formatted
 as a background job, the repainting is done much better etc.).

File should be smaller than before (smarter way of saving
 the formatting information)

Real document/view separation, working with different views on the same
document is fully functional, cursors are in each view.

Brand new formula widget (with doc/view design, zoom support etc.).
Redesigned table support.
Much improved find/replace functionality.

Other new features:
 - Real bullets instead of using characters as bullets.
 - Line-level breaking of paragraphs at end of frame/page
 - Right margin for a paragraph.
 - Undo/redo fully working (all text operations, but also frame operations etc.)
 
Fixes:
 - Embedding a kpresenter part into kword now works
 - Copy/Paste and Drag-and-drop work as expected (instead of for full paragraphs only)

When Qt3 is out, KWord will support bi-directional editing of text (for hebrew, arabic etc.).

Changes between KWord-1.1-beta1 and KWord-1.1-beta2
===================================================

Copying frames has been implemented, fixing headers and footers.
Implemented tabulators (left/right/center/decimal aligned).
Implemented floating framesets, mainly for inline formulas and tables.
KWord can now be embedded into another KOffice application.
More precise coordinate system (especially for frames).
Many improvements for tables (including splitting and merging cells).
Highlight mispelled word during spell-checking, and spell-check all framesets.
UI improvements, undo/redo fixes, font-size fix, border-drawing improved, etc.
Many new variables available.
Redesigned style editor (stylist), now all in one dialog.
When changing a style, only the changes are applied to existing paragraphs (not the whole style).
Fixed drawing and printing of embedded objects.
Respect user's color scheme.
Improved visual appearance (page shape, with shadow).

Changes between KWord-1.1-beta2 and KWord-1.1-beta3 (under development)
===================================================

New view mode: preview (multiple pages per row)
Inline items (variables, images, frames) are now correctly drawn as selected.
Improved readonly mode, when embedding into konqueror (can now select and copy).
Insert Frame/Page Break feature added (also as part of styles).
Apply button added to the stylist.
Zoom value can be set arbitrarily by the user (editable combobox).
Auto-correction, typographical quotes.
Insertion of predefined expressions.

Fixed recalculation of "page number" variable in header or footer.
Painting and run-around-frame fixes (e.g. in multi-columns mode).
Fixes for the creation and removal of pages.
Fixed crash when embedding into Konqueror.
Many other fixes.
