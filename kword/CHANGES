Reggie, 9.9.1998:
-----------------
- Attributes for writing text can be set with the
  toolbar now. So it's possible to write with defferent
  attributes now.
  I only miss the attribute 'underlined' in KWFormat!
  I'll implement that.
- The attributes, which are shown in the toolbar, are
  automatically updated when moving the cursor.
- There were lots of bugs with calculating the correct font
  width/height when typing characters and moving the cursor.
  I fixed lots of problems here, but I'm sure there are still
  some more. Especially with KWFormatContext::apply() the
  displayFont and the (max)Ascents/(max)Descents were not
  updated. I fixed that.
- I also fixed a bug when breaking lines, so that the cursor
  is placed correctly if it jumps to the next line.
- Fixed a redraw bug.
- Fixed a problem in KWDisplayFont.

Reggie, 10.9.1998:
------------------
- Introduced font attribute UNDERLINE.
- Implemented 'bool KWString::remove(unsigned int _pos,unsigned int _len)',
  'void KWString::append(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len) and
  'KWChar* KWString::copy(KWChar *_data,unsigned int _len)'
- Implemented 'bool KWParag::deleteText(pos,len)',
  'void KWParag::appendText(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len)'.

Reggie, 11.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented Key_Delete and Key_Backspace, and everything which
  was needed for that. There are still lots of problems with that,
  especially with placing the cursor and redrawing.
- Implemented Key_Return (== Key_Enter). It seems to work ok, but I'm sure
  that there are also some problems in it (the same as for Key_Delete and
  Key_Backspace). That's because I'm still not totally fimilar with the
  KWFormatContext. So, Torben, please look at the new implemented
  KeyPressEvents and fix the stuff which I did wrong :-))
- Fixed a bug in "Blocksatz" (avoided division by zero if there are no
  spaces in a line).
- Fixed a bug in freeChar().
- There are bigger problems with alignment center and right. The width of
  a line is not calculated correctly - we have to find a way to do that
  quite fast _and_ correctly.

Reggie, 13.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented KWFormatCollection, and it's already working

- Everything which worked before the page-orientation -> frame-orientation changes, works again now
- Implemented templates
- Started implementation of printing (at the moment, only the dialog opens :-)
- Fixed lots of speed problems in KWFormatContext when editing long textes. It was terribly slow.
  But it's possible that I introduced some bugs - if this is the case I'll, of course, fix them :-)
  What I did: KWFormatContext::init(..) is called quite often when navigating with the cursor (e.g
  a line up, deleting/inserting text, etc.).
  The implementation of this init methode started at the first parag of the text and went through
  _all_ paragraphs, until the needed one was reached. For long textes (I tested with 70 pages) this was
  damn slow when you were nearly at the end of the text. Now init doesn't go through all parags anymore
  if it is not really needed (and it is nearly never needed!). So this is much faster now.

  Currently you will not see much :-)

Reggie, 3.2.1999:
-----------------
- Small fix with setting page borders on rulers
- Showing the paragraph arrangement (Gliederung) of the text framesets
  in the document structure viewer works
- The document structure viewer isn't updated automatically at the moment - just
  close and open the "Arrangement" branch to update it
- Added a demo document with some chapters and different depths to demonstrate
  the document structure viewer

Reggie, 4.2.1999:
-----------------
- Double click on a paragraph branch in the arrangement branch of the document
  structur viewer sets the cursor to this paragraph in the text view
- Text frames and text frame sets are listed in the docu structure viewer
- Tables are listed in the docu structure viewer
- Pictures are listed in the docu structure viewer
- Embedded objects are listed in the docu structure viewer

Reggie, 5.2.1999:
-----------------
- Double click on a text frame branch in the document
  structur viewer scrolls to this text frame in the text view
- Double click on a table branch in the document
  structur viewer scrolls to this table in the text view
- Double click on a picture branch in the document
  structur viewer scrolls to this picture in the text view
- Double click on a embedded object branch in the document
  structur viewer scrolls to this embedded object in the text view
- Fix with activating an embedded part
- Loading embedded parts doesn't crash anymore

Reggie, 6.2.1999:
-----------------
- More work on variables

Reggie, 7.2.1999:
-----------------
- Small fix in printLine

Reggie, 11.2.1999:

Reggie, 17.2.1999:
------------------

Reggie, 18.2.1999:
------------------
- When a table flows over multiple pages the header (= first row)
  is shown on the beginning of the table part on each page. I'll
  add the possibility to switch this on/off - now it's on by
  default. Only the automatically added headers are not up-to-date
  all the time currently - I'll fix that.

Reggie, 24.2.1999:
------------------
- When a table flows over multiple pages and the table-header is copied to
  each page, it is updated correctly now.

Reggie, 25.2.1999:
------------------

- Fixed some memory leaking code
- Table headers get really updated correctly now - there is only a repaint problem there now...

-----------------
- Implemented date variable and date variable format
- Implemented inserting variables (works with date variables)
- Some fixes in formatting text

Reggie, 2.3 - 6.3 1999:
------------------
- Porting to Qt 2.0 and lots of fixes for that

- Fixes

Reggie, 11.3.1999:
------------------
- Implemented KWordDrag which will be used for storing data on the clipboard and for DnD
- Using new features (QMimeSource stuff) of the QClipboard
- Text is copied as text/plain and in native KWord format (application/x-kword) to the clipboard (using KWordDrag as QMimeSource)
  (only partly implemented)
- When pasting text: If native KWord format (application/x-kword) is provided, this is used, else text/plain is used
  (only partly implemented)
=> when cut/copy/pasting between or in KWord documents, formatting is copied/pasted too now

Reggie, 12.3.1999:
------------------
- Some fixes

- Some fixes in variables

Reggie, 19.3.1999:
------------------
- Fixed saving variables
- Some fixes and improvements in variables
- Using QChar instead of char in the KWString class now => KWord supports Unicode (at least I hope so :-)
- edit->paste gets enabled/disabled according to the clipboard data

- Fixes in the GUI
- Started with internals for joining/splitting cells

Reggie, 24.3.1999:
------------------
- Added menu entry for splitting table cells
- Improved Tables:
  - It's possible to ungroup a table (each cell becomes an own frameset - ok,
    they are always own frame sets, but the table manager stops controlling them
    in this case)
  - More internal work for joining/splitting table cells

Reggie, 25.3.1999:
------------------
- More work on joining table cells:
  - Joining in horizontal direction works sort of - but
    some strange things are still going on here ;-)
- Made some menu items functional

Reggie, 26.3.1999:
------------------
- Joining table cells in horizontal direction works quite well now
  (at least it doesn't crash anymore and resizes correctly :-)

Reggie, 27.3.1999:
------------------
- Implemented joining table cells in vertical direction
  (only the auto-resize of vertical joined table cells screws
   up a table a bit - will fix it)

Reggie, 28.3.1999:
------------------
- Clicking on joined/hidden tables cells works correctly now
- Some menu items/toolbar pics for table manipulations get disabled/enabled
  correctly to avoid mistakes by the user

Reggie, 29.3.1999:
------------------
- For joining cells it's not required anymore to put the cursor
  into the table first
- Implemented splitting cells - this means you can only split a joined
  cell yet, no "normal" cells. I'll improve that later.
- Prepeared everything for context sensitive right button menus

Reggie, 1.4.1999:
-----------------
- Started implementing footnotes and endnotes
