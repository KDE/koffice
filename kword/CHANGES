Reggie, 9.9.1998:
-----------------
- Attributes for writing text can be set with the
  toolbar now. So it's possible to write with defferent
  attributes now.
  I only miss the attribute 'underlined' in KWFormat! 
  I'll implement that.
- The attributes, which are shown in the toolbar, are
  automatically updated when moving the cursor.
- There were lots of bugs with calculating the correct font
  width/height when typing characters and moving the cursor.
  I fixed lots of problems here, but I'm sure there are still
  some more. Especially with KWFormatContext::apply() the
  displayFont and the (max)Ascents/(max)Descents were not
  updated. I fixed that.
- I also fixed a bug when breaking lines, so that the cursor
  is placed correctly if it jumps to the next line.
- Fixed a redraw bug.
- Fixed a problem in KWDisplayFont.

Reggie, 10.9.1998:
------------------
- Introduced font attribute UNDERLINE.
- Implemented 'bool KWString::remove(unsigned int _pos,unsigned int _len)', 
  'void KWString::append(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len) and 
  'KWChar* KWString::copy(KWChar *_data,unsigned int _len)'
- Implemented 'bool KWParag::deleteText(pos,len)', 
  'void KWParag::appendText(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len)'.

Reggie, 11.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented Key_Delete and Key_Backspace, and everything which 
  was needed for that. There are still lots of problems with that,
  especially with placing the cursor and redrawing.
- Implemented Key_Return (== Key_Enter). It seems to work ok, but I'm sure
  that there are also some problems in it (the same as for Key_Delete and
  Key_Backspace). That's because I'm still not totally fimilar with the
  KWFormatContext. So, Torben, please look at the new implemented
  KeyPressEvents and fix the stuff which I did wrong :-))
- Fixed a bug in "Blocksatz" (avoided division by zero if there are no
  spaces in a line).
- Fixed a bug in freeChar().
- There are bigger problems with alignment center and right. The width of
  a line is not calculated correctly - we have to find a way to do that
  quite fast _and_ correctly.

Reggie, 13.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented KWFormatCollection, and it's already working
- fixed a bug in "Blocksatz"

Reggie, 14.9.1998:
------------------
- Fixed finally THE bug in KWString :-)
- Totally integrated KWFormatCollecion
- Fixed a bug in backspace
- Fixed a bug with joining paragraphs
- Fixed a redraw problem with delete/backspace, but there are still
  problems with setting the cursor.
- Bugfix in printLine
- Bugfix in Key_Delete
- Improoved speed of deleting/inserting text and scrolling the canvas
  (now only the visible text is repainted) 
- Some bugfixes in the KWFormatContext and in printing lines

Reggie, 15.9.1998:
------------------
- Fixed a bug with setting formats
- Added some new GUI stuff

Reggie, 16.9.1998:
------------------
- Started working on alignments/flows. Now you can choose the flow
  for the current paragraph via the toolbar, and the toolbar is
  updated automatically when moving the cursor. Now I have to
  work on the implementation of CENTER and RIGHT, this is really
  broken at the moment...

Reggie, 17.9.1998:
------------------
- Started working on CENTER flow
- Started writing a dialog for paragraph settings

Reggie, 18.9.1998:
------------------

- Fixed a redraw problem (with setting some clippings)

Reggie, 19.9.1998:
------------------
- Worked on paragraph settings dialog
- Some improvements with linebreaking
- Fixed bug in cursor navigation
- Fixed bug in "Blocksatz"

Reggie, 20.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented configurable left indent and first line left indent
- Fixed some bugs in cursor navigation

- Automatically recalc/update of the cursor, if a new page/paragraph layout is set 

Reggie, 21.9.1998:
------------------
- Using new interactive KoRuler (which I started writing today) instead of KRuler.
- First trial of linespacing... 

Reggie, 22.9.1998:
------------------

  It already works somehow...

------------------
- More work on pictures as characters

Reggie, 26.9.1998:
------------------
- Fixed some problems with deleting Text (Key_Delete/Key_Backspace) and
  linebreaking
- Improved KFormatContext::makeLineLayout() to make the linebreaking more
  precise and to make it work correctly with special characters (like pictures)

Reggie, 28.9.1998:
------------------
- Added JPEG filter
- some fixes

Reggie, 29.9.1998:
