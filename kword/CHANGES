Main changes between KWord-0.8 (KOffice-1.0) and KWord-1.1-beta1
========================================================================

New overall design and new formatting engine.

Better zooming; adapts to the DPI settings (of the screen and of the printer)
This means, if your X server is correctly configured, the page on screen has
the same size as the real paper page.

Much better performance with huge documents (the text is formatted
 as a background job, the repainting is done much better etc.).

File should be smaller than before (smarter way of saving
 the formatting information)

Real document/view separation, working with different views on the same
document is fully functional, cursors are in each view.

Brand new formula widget (with doc/view design, zoom support etc.).
Redesigned table support.
Much improved find/replace functionality.

Other new features:
 - Real bullets instead of using characters as bullets.
 - Line-level breaking of paragraphs at end of frame/page
 - Right margin for a paragraph.
 - Undo/redo fully working (all text operations, but also frame operations etc.)
 
Fixes:
 - Embedding a kpresenter part into kword now works
 - Copy/Paste and Drag-and-drop work as expected (instead of for full paragraphs only)

When Qt3 is out, KWord will support bi-directional editing of text (for hebrew, arabic etc.).
