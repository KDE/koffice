Reggie, 9.9.1998:
-----------------
- Attributes for writing text can be set with the
  toolbar now. So it's possible to write with defferent
  attributes now.
  I only miss the attribute 'underlined' in KWFormat! 
  I'll implement that.
- The attributes, which are shown in the toolbar, are
  automatically updated when moving the cursor.
- There were lots of bugs with calculating the correct font
  width/height when typing characters and moving the cursor.
  I fixed lots of problems here, but I'm sure there are still
  some more. Especially with KWFormatContext::apply() the
  displayFont and the (max)Ascents/(max)Descents were not
  updated. I fixed that.
- I also fixed a bug when breaking lines, so that the cursor
  is placed correctly if it jumps to the next line.
- Fixed a redraw bug.
- Fixed a problem in KWDisplayFont.

Reggie, 10.9.1998:
------------------
- Introduced font attribute UNDERLINE.
- Implemented 'bool KWString::remove(unsigned int _pos,unsigned int _len)', 
  'void KWString::append(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len) and 
  'KWChar* KWString::copy(KWChar *_data,unsigned int _len)'
- Implemented 'bool KWParag::deleteText(pos,len)', 'void KWParag::appendText(KWChar* _text,unsigned int _len)'.

Reggie, 11.9.1998:
------------------
- Implemented Key_Delete and Key_Backspace, and everything which 
  was needed for that. There are still lots of problems with that,
  especially with placing the cursor and redrawing.
