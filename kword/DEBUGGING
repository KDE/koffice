Tips for developers
===================

KWord has a few hidden keys (aka easter-eggs :) that help debugging it,
without the need for menuitems to be removed before releasing.

The current debug keys are:

Alt-Ctrl-Shift-F : Frames debug. Outputs information about all existing frames.
Ctrl-Shift-P : Paragraphs debug. Outputs information about all paragraphs of the current frameset.
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-S : Styles debug. Prints all KoStyles.
Alt-Ctrl-Shift-M : Mark the debug output. Just prints the current date/time.

(The code is in koffice/kword/part/KWCanvas.cpp method keyReleaseEvent() and in the textTool)
