** Kivio:
 - Fix grid painting
 - Fix loading of remote documents

* Features:


** Krita:
 - Add histograms
 - Histograms for images with more than 8-bit to the channel can be zoomed
 - Add histogram docker
 - Many filters are now colorspace independent
 - Add CMYK (8 and 16 bit)
 - Add 16-bit grayscale
 - Image separation feature
 - Add openEXR support
 - Separate painting styles from tools; now every tool, from freehand to star can use any
   painting style (eraser, brush, pen, airbrush...)
 - Create better and more modern selection visualisation
 - Put brush, gradient, pattern and paint style in popups in a toolbar, reducing the amount
   of space Krita needs for its dockers
 - Make hardness of tablet pressure curve configurable
 - Many performance improvements to the backend (allocation cache, transform cache)
 - Use color profiles everywhere
 - New curves widget for color adjustments
 - Add feather selection feature
 - Pasted clipboard contents are placed in the middle of the image initially
 - Brush shape is shown as an outline cursor when painting freehand
 - Krita now adds itself to the Open With menu in Konqueror
 - support more modes from GImp image hose brushes
 - Much work on documentation
 - Allow the user to choose between contiguous fill behaviour in combination with selections. 
   Either fill the entire selection, or floodfill the image, but taking the selection into 
   account (default behaviour).
 - Add a 16-bit float half format RGB colourspace and change the OpenEXR filters to use it. 
   Will probably add the option to load into 32-bit float as that should be faster.
 - 16-bit XYZ is now the fallback colormodel when a particular colormodel doesn't implement
   a certain function
 - Filter gallery feature
 - Add an option to the colorpicker to pick colors not just from the active or
   from all visible layers, but from any layer, while still working on this layer.
 - Tools and most menu items now are disabled when a layer is invisible or locked.
 - Add noise reduction filter
 - Made scrolling with a scrollwheel work better
 - Add round corners filter
 - Add sobel filter
 - Made crop tool much more usable
 - Add small tiles filter
 - Add pixellize filter

 - KWord makes selecting/moving/resizing frames easier by implementing all features from http://www.koffice.org/developer/keyboardmodifiers.php

** KSpread:
 - 	Added cell reference highlighting when editing formulae.  Also added click-and-drag resizing
	of ranges referenced in formulae.
 -	Greatly improved OpenDocument support
 -	Sort dialog displays column & row names instead of "Column A","Column B" for selecting sort criteria
