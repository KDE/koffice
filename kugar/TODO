All components:
- set positions and dimensions in real dpi-independent units like santimeters, inches
  and get rid of all other dpi dependecies

Kudesigner:
- Z-Ordering (right-click menu) for report items
    default: all items are created with the same z-position 
- print and print preview
- open x-kugarmixed files ???
- do not allow to move report items out of their section (Works, except when moved/resized with the property editor or during placing of new items)
- make a grid for element placing
- implement "smart" moving of elements (stick to borders)
- automatic resize of property editor
- save position and size of the property editor
- undo / redo
	redo items don't work afrer undo section!
- cut / copy / paste
- DCOP interface
- more flexible uncompressed file save (maybe export filter)

- optimizations:
-- create property editor widgets only once
-- do not repaint selected items during selection (review algo if (selectionStarted) in ReportCanvas::contentsMouseMoveEvent())
-- remove unnesesary canvas_item->hide() and show() 	| code review
-- same for canvas()->update()				| nesessary

- CRUSHES
-- undo item, undo section, redo item --> crush

Kugar engine:
-  More work on direct database support in the engine:
   Allow merging existing data files and generated ones by MDatabaseReportEngine
-  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
   n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
-  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
   total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
-  Look at adding some chart types.
-  For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
   to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
   format, eg. paper size (dont forget Vishakan's wishes).
-  Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.


Kugar shell(part):
- --print --from <number> --to <number> --copies <number> --printer <name>
    AD: I have some pathes for kugar/lib and kugar/shell (deprecated shell)
