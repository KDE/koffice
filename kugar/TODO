Kudesigner:
- Z-Ordering (right-click menu) for report items
    default: all items are created with the same z-position 
- selection of the template itself (on click)
- selection and resize boxes for report sections
     ___________________
    / Report Section  + \______________
    |                    
- print and print preview
- open x-kugarmixed files ???
- do not allow to move report items out of their section (Works, except when moved/resized with the property editor or during placing of new items)
- make a grid for element placing
- implement "smart" moving of elements (stick to borders)
- automatic resize of property editor
- save position and size of the property editor
- undo / redo
- cut / copy / paste
- DCOP interface
- more flexible uncompressed file save (maybe export filter)

- optimizations:
-- create property editor widgets only once
-- do not repaint selected items during selection (review algo if (selectionStarted) in ReportCanvas::contentsMouseMoveEvent())
-- remove unnesesary canvas_item->hide() and show() 	| code review
-- same for canvas()->update()				| nesessary

- CRUSHES
-- delete item, insert item --> crush

Kugar engine:
-  Add FieldList element to the Detail element (for Kexi):
    <!ELEMENT FieldList (Field+)>
    <!ELEMENT Field>
    <!ATTLIST Field
	Name CDATA #REQUIRED
	Type CDATA #IMPLIED>
-  Add direct database support into the engine (maybe):
    DTD can be extended to allow:
	<DataSource Name="" ParentName="" Driver=""
		 	Database="" HostName="" Port=""
	        	Query="" Username="" Password="">
		<DataField X="" Y="" ... />
		<Label ... />
	</DataSource>					
	<DataDetail Height="" DataSource="">
	</DataDetail>				
-  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
   n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
-  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
   total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
-  Look at adding some chart types.
-  For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
   to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
   format, eg. paper size.
-  Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.


Kugar shell(part):
- --print --from <number> --to <number> --copies <number> --printer <name>
    AD: have some pathes for kugar/lib and kugar/shell (deprecated shell)
