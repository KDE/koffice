0.  Add direct database support into the engine:
    DTD can be extended to allow:
	<DataSource Name="" ParentName="" Driver=""
		 	Database="" HostName="" Port=""
	        	Query="" Username="" Password="">
		<DataField X="" Y="" ... />
		<Label ... />
	</DataSource>					
	<DataDetail Height="" DataSource="">
	</DataDetail>				
1.  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
    n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
2.  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
    total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
3.  Look at adding some chart types.
4.  Fix the problem putting the KPart menu options into the Konqueror Go menu
    (where I think they should be) - rather than the View menu.
5.  Make the Report Viewer's GUI more sophisticated - a right button menu
    containing the page navigation options for example.
6.  Make the shell a proper shell (ie. use KPart::MainWindow) and remove the
    duplicated code.
7.  Implement session management in the shell and designer.
8.  Add a recent reports list to the shell.
9.  For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
    to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
    format, eg. paper size.
10. Fix the bug with Konqueror which means that the scrollbars don't get
    displayed until Konqueror is re-sized.
11. Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.
