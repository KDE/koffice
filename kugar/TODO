Kugar engine:
-  Add FieldList element to the Detail element:
    <!ELEMENT FieldList (Field+)>
    <!ELEMENT Field>
    <!ATTLIST Field
	Name CDATA #REQUIRED
	Type CDATA #IMPLIED>
-  Add direct database support into the engine:
    DTD can be extended to allow:
	<DataSource Name="" ParentName="" Driver=""
		 	Database="" HostName="" Port=""
	        	Query="" Username="" Password="">
		<DataField X="" Y="" ... />
		<Label ... />
	</DataSource>					
	<DataDetail Height="" DataSource="">
	</DataDetail>				
-  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
   n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
-  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
   total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
-  Look at adding some chart types.
-  For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
   to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
   format, eg. paper size.
-  Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.


Kugar shell(part):
- ???? review of current development status needed ????
- --print --from <number> --to <number> --copies <number> --printer <name>
    AD: have some pathes for kugar/lib and kugar/shell (deprecated shell)
