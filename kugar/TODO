1.  Review the progress updating in the engine - use either percentages or Page
    n of m.  Integrate properly with the Konqueror status bar.
2.  The engine should also report (through signals) the current page and the
    total number of pages so that the GUI can display them on the status line.
3.  Look at adding some chart types.
4   Write a GUI report template designer.
5.  Fix the problem putting the KPart menu options into the Konqueror Go menu
    (where I think they should be) - rather than the View menu.
6.  Make the GUI more sophisticated - a right button menu containing the page
    navigation options for example.
7.  Fix the problem where the First Page/Last Page buttons don't appear on the
    shell toolbar.
8.  Make the shell a proper shell (ie. use KPart::MainWindow) and remove the
    duplicated code.
9.  Implement session management in the shell.
10. Add a recent reports list to the shell.
11. For some template elements we want the user (ie. the data DTD) to be able
    to optionally override them to give them some local control over the
    format, eg. paper size.
12. Review MReportViewer::printReport().  Should it display the printer dialog?
    What if there is a KDE specific printer dialog?
13. Fix the bug with Konqueror which means that the scrollbars don't get
    displayed until Konqueror is re-sized.
14. Improve the error reporting - particularly about bad XML.
