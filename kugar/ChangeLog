*************************
VERSION 0.2
*************************

Changes:

 1. Added new class MLineObject for drawing simple lines on a report.
 2. Moved metaphrast code to a seperate dir and added code to create a shared
    library.
 3. Switched from IBM XML4C to Apache Xerces XML Parser. Not using ICU, just
    native transcoding.
 4. Added command line switches to the viewer utility.
 5. Added support for formatting negative numbers with a user defined color.
 6. Added currency data type to field and calc objects.
 7. Added support for formatting numbers.
 8. Added support for formatting dates. To format dates, the field type must be
    defined as a date and the date string in the data file must be in
    mm/dd/yyyy or mm-dd-yyyy format.
 9. Fixed bug that added an empty page to the end of a report.
10. Added a progress dialog to MReportViewer for printing. User can now cancel
    a print job.
11. Added code to MReportViewer to allow printing of selected pages.
12. Added code to MReportViewer to print multiple copies. QPrinter does not
    appear to handle this correctly.
13. Added code to MReportViewer to print reverse page order.
14. Added method getRenderSteps() to MReportEngine, returns count of rendering
    steps required to process the report.  Convenience funtion for UI progress
    indicators.
15. Added signal signalRenderStatus(int) to MReportEngine to track rendering
    progress.  Convenience funtion for UI progress indicators.
16. Added public slot cancelRendering() to MReportEngine to cancel report
    rendering.
17. Added a progress dialog for report rendering to MReportViewer.  User can
    now cancel report processing.
18. Changed rendering code to draw at absolute y position. Previous version
    used to subtract 1 from the y pos so that bordered fields would not have
    double borders on one side.  Existing reports that used bordered fields in
    this way will need to be modified, shrink the height of the report section
    by one - the bordered fields will still form a grid (see samplereport1.xml).
19. Added clear functions to report sections so the report engine can clear
    existing formatting data before setting a new report template.
