	* kudesigner:
	Kudesigner rework:
	most functionality is moved to kudesigner_lib and made platform-independant (qt only or necessary #ifdefs)
	only document-view-application arch implementation remains.
	Main goal: to create qt version of kugar designer with minimal effort (common/shared code will be in kudesigner_lib).
	
	* kudesigner_lib:
	Common kugar designer library created. Compiles with qt only (qt only compile should utilize PURE_QT define).
	
	* kudesigner_qt2:
	Alternate Qt only Kugar Designer created (uses kudesigner_lib).
	
	* shell_qt2:
	Alternate Qt only Kugar shell created.
	
	* kudesigner:
	Undo/Redo for report items works now without crashes if their parent section was undone.

2003-05-01 Joris Marcillac <joris@marcillac.org>
	* lib:
	Direct database support. Databases and queries can be specified withing template
	file and then the data file can be generated
	* samplesdb:
	Example program that shows usage of the direct database support in Kugar.

2003-04-05 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Undo/Redo implemented for all insert actions
	
2003-04-01 Per Winkvist <per.winkvist@cellnetwork.com>
	* kudesigner:
	Add check in DoubleClickEvent that we used LeftButton
	Allow + and - keys to be used to change FontSize
	Allow Del key to be used to delete an item

2003-03-31 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Applied patch from Per Winkvist <per.winkvist@cellnetwork.com>: 
	Fast property editing (name, fieldname) like in Qt Designer

2003-03-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kugar:
	Qt only version of the designer and preliminary version of shell added to the repository.
	Qt only versions aren't compiled with kde. They should be compiled by hand using
	qmake kugar.pro
	make -f Makefile.qt (on unix)
	QMake and automake coexist normally;)
	Qt only Kugar Designer and shell do not support KOffice zipped xml files
	Preliminary qt-shell is written by Joris Marcillac <joris@marcillac.org>
	* lib:
	Fixes for qt-only compilation, thanks to Joris Marcillac <joris@marcillac.org>

2003-03-16 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Code reorganization to make it more modular

2003-02-25 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at>
	* part:
	 1) Don't crash anymore if a template file can't be loaded
	 2) Support kudesigner koStore template files (That's a littlebit hacky.
	    Once ku{gar|designer} supports images the loading has to be redone a littlebit, but for now it works
	 3) Relative template pathes are now relative to the data file, not to the current working directory

2003-01-25 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner:
	Canvas Bands can now be resized with the mouse
	Changed resizehandle paint code. They are painted above all items now.
	Changed mouse <-> resize handle interaction. 
	If the resizehandle is displayed partly above an item which has a higher z-order 
	than the item they belong too, a resize operation is still triggerd. 
	That makes section resizeable, if they have a report item in the middle which fills the whole height

2003-01-21 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner: 
	1) Let a plugin access the property, it should create a editor for.
	   There is a new type enum UserDefined, which should mark the beginning of user defineable property types.
	   If there is no custom editor created, user defined types will show a lineedit.
	2) Now all resize grips works for report items.
	3) Support for properties, which should not be saved into the kugar template file

2003-01-19 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner:
	Pluggable property editors, bands are now resizable with the property editor
	
2003-01-16 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner: 
	Now it is ensured, that items can't be moved out of ther section or resized to be larger than a section.

2003-01-03 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Many visual editors for properties created - font and color combos, etc.
	
2002-12-29 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Property editing in designer is coming back with the new Property Editor widget
	
2002-11-23 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* part:
	Part is now a KOffice part, old shell disabled, new part-based shell is ready to use

2002-09-22 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mskat.net>
	* kudesigner:
	Porting to KoDocument/KoFactory/KoView/KoAcclication started

2002-09-20 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
