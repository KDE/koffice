	* kugar:
	Qt only version of the designer and preliminary version of shell added to the repository.
	Qt only versions aren't compiled with kde. They should be compiled by hand using
	qmake kugar.pro
	QMake and automake coexist normally;)
	Qt only Kugar Designer and shell do not support KOffice zipped xml files
	Preliminary qt-shell is written by Joris Marcillac <joris@marcillac.com>
	* lib:
	Fixes for qt-only compilation, thanks to Joris Marcillac <joris@marcillac.com>

	* kudesigner:
	Code reorganization to make it more modular

2003-02-25 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at>
	* part:
	 1) Don't crash anymore if a template file can't be loaded
	 2) Support kudesigner koStore template files (That's a littlebit hacky.
	    Once ku{gar|designer} supports images the loading has to be redone a littlebit, but for now it works
	 3) Relative template pathes are now relative to the data file, not to the current working directory

2003-01-25 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner:
	Canvas Bands can now be resized with the mouse
	Changed resizehandle paint code. They are painted above all items now.
	Changed mouse <-> resize handle interaction. 
	If the resizehandle is displayed partly above an item which has a higher z-order 
	than the item they belong too, a resize operation is still triggerd. 
	That makes section resizeable, if they have a report item in the middle which fills the whole height

2003-01-21 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner: 
	1) Let a plugin access the property, it should create a editor for.
	   There is a new type enum UserDefined, which should mark the beginning of user defineable property types.
	   If there is no custom editor created, user defined types will show a lineedit.
	2) Now all resize grips works for report items.
	3) Support for properties, which should not be saved into the kugar template file

2003-01-19 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner:
	Pluggable property editors, bands are now resizable with the property editor
	
2003-01-16 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@jowenn.at> 
	* kudesigner: 
	Now it is ensured, that items can't be moved out of ther section or resized to be larger than a section.

2003-01-03 Alexander Dymo <cloudtemple@mksat.net>
	* kudesigner:
