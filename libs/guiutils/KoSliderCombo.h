/**
 * @short A widget for qreal values with a popup slider
 *
 * KoSliderCombo combines a numerical input and a dropdown slider in a way that takes up as
 * little screen space as possible.
 * 
 * It allows the user to either enter a floating point value or quickly set the value using a slider
 * 
 * One signal is emitted when the value changes. The signal is even emitted when the slider
 * is moving. The second argument of the signal however tells you if the value is final or not. A
 * final value is produced by entering a value numerically or by releasing the slider.
 * 
 * The input of the numerical line edit is constrained to numbers and decimal signs.
