 * This controller class handles zoom levels for any canvas.
 *
 * For each KoCanvasController you should have one instance of this
 * class to go with it. This class then creates a KoZoomAction and
 * basically handles all zooming for you.
 *
 * All you need to do is connect to the setDocumentSize() slot and
 * keep the controller up-to-date if your on-screen document ever
 * changes (note that this is in document units, so this is a zoom
 * independent size).
 *
 * If you choose to have zoom modes of 'page' and 'width' you are
 * required to set the page size using the setPageSize() method.
 *
 * Additionally you can connect to the zoomChanged() signal if you
 * want to store the latest zoom level and mode, for example to
 * restore the last used one at next restart.
 *
 * The specialAspectMode toggle is only a UI element. It does nothing
 * except emit the aspectModeChanged signal.
