/**
 * This controller class handles zoom levels for any canvas. (koguiutils)
 *
 * For each KoCanvasController you instantiate this class once. This class then creates
 * a KoZoomAction and basically handles all zooming for you.
 *
 * All you have to do is connect to zoomChanged so that you can redraw your canvas.
 * You don't have to concern yourself with fit to width modes or anything.
*
 * The specialAspectMode toggle is only a UI element. It does nothing except emit the
 * aspectModeChanged signal.
 *
 * As documentation follows a description of the internal workflow:
 * # the user changes the slider/combo which causes the zoomAction to fire.
 * This will cause the private slot setZoom(mode, double) to be called which will
 * then cause the controller to calculate the effective zoomlevel. In mode
 * constant the zoomlevel is forwarded, in mode pageWidth this is calculated based
 * on the page size and the canvas size (the latter can be fetched from the
 * canvasController)
 * 
 * # KoView or decendent calls setZoom(double) / setZoomMode(mode)
 * Mostly used just one time for the initialisation.
 * uses the same code as the previous case to determine the effective zoomlevel.
 * Will set the effective zoom on the CanvasController.
 * 
 * # The user uses the zoomTool to zoom to a specific rect.
 * The zoom tool acts on the CanvasController to adjust the zoom level.
 * The canvasController emits the a request to alter zoom (as a factor of current zoom)
 * which the zoomController then acts upon and emits for the application to persist.  It
 * will alter the the mode to percent based.
