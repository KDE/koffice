/**
 * Allow multiple subtasks to safely update and report progress.
 * This class is able to update a progress bar with the total progress
 * of a project that may be separated into different subtasks.
 * Each subtask will use one KoUpdater which that subtask can then report
 * progress to.  Each KoUpdater.setProgress() call will automatically calculate
 * the total progress over the whole tasks made and update the progress bar
 * with the total progress so far.
 *
 * This class is created specifically with threading in mind so that subtasks
 * can report their progress from their personal subthread and the progress bar
 * will be updated correctly and not more often then repaints can return.
 *
 * Typical usage can be:
 * @code
  KoProgressUpdater *pu = new KoProgressUpdater(myProgressBar);
  pu->start(100);
  // create the subtasks
  KoUpdater smooth = pu->startSubtask(5);
  KoUpdater scale = pu->startSubtask(5);
  KoUpdater cleanup = pu->startSubtask(1);
  @endcode
 * Doing an smooth.setProgress(50) will move the progress bar to 50% of the share
 * of task 'smooth' which is 5 / 11 of the total and thus to 22.
 *
 *
 * KoProgressUpdater should be created in the main thread;
 * KoProgressProxy must be, if it is gui subclass in the QApplication
 * main thread. The other objects can be created in whatever thread
 * one wants.
