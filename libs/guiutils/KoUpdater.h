 * The thread it is used in can be different from any other subtask or the
 * KoProgressUpdater, though.
 *
 * It is possible to create a KoProgressUpdater on a KoUpdater for when you
 * need to recursively split up progress reporting. (For instance, when your
 * progress reporting routine can be called by other progress reporting
 * routines.)
 *
 * KoUpdater implements KoProgressProxy because it is possible to recursively
 * create another KoProgressUpdater with an updater as progress proxy.
