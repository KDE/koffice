/**
 * A KoColorSpaceEngine is a class use to create color conversion
 * transformation between color spaces, for which all profiles can
 * output to all profiles.
 * 
 * Typically, when you have an ICC color space and color profile, you
 * can convert to any other ICC color space and color profile. While
 * creating a KoColorTransformationFactory for each of this transformation
 * is possible, the number of link will make explode the Color Conversion
 * System. KoColorSpaceEngine will provides a virtual node in the Color
 * Conversion System that can convert to any other node supported by the
 * engine.
