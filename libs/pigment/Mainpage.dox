 * Pigment is a Color Manipulation System with pluggable color spaces. Color spaces
 * can be based on the <a href="http://www.littlecms.com">LCMS library</a>, or using
 * the <a href="http://www.openctl.org">OpenCTL</a> implmenetation of the Color
 * Transformation Language. But that is not a requirement. 
 *
 * Pigment color spaces offers support for many common manipulations and for
 * pixel composition. Pigment works on arrays of bytes: the color spaces interpret
 * the array of bytes as a pixel according to the pixel format defined by each
 * color space.
