 * Pigment is a colormanagement library with pluggable colorspaces. Colorspaces
 * can be based on the <a href="http://www.littlecms.com">LCMS library</a>, but
 * that is not a requirement. 
 *
 * Pigment colorspaces offers support for many common manipulations and for
 * pixel composition. Pigment works on arrays of bytes: the colorspaces interpret
 * the array of bytes as a pixel according to the pixel format defined by each
 * colorspace.
