This test suite automates the test cases at 
http://develop.opendocumentfellowship.com/testsuite/.

How to run the test suite - 3 steps
-----------------------------------

1) Install QtScript bindings generator:

  The ODF test suite requires QScript bindings for Qt. Clone the repository
  of the QtScript bindings generator from Gitorious by running:

    $ git clone git://gitorious.org/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator.git

  (The created directory is called $QTSCRIPTGENERATOR from now on).

  Please read the README in the generator package. Once you have done that,
  create the generator by compiling inside the 'generator' directory:

    $ cd $QTSCRIPTGENERATOR/generator && qmake && make

  Run the generator:

    $ ./generator

  Make sure that the QTDIR environment variable points to the Qt that you
  compiled KOffice against, and that the right qmake command is in your PATH
  This will create bindings for Qt.

2) Compile QtScript bindings for Qt:

  Now we have to compile the C++ code generated in the above step. We need
  only QtCore and QtGui bindings, so modify the qtbindings/qtbindings.pro to
  read something like:

  TEMPLATE = subdirs
  SUBDIRS = qtscript_core \
          qtscript_gui \
          qs_eval

  And then compile the bindings in the 'qtbindings' directory:

    $ cd $QTSCRIPTGENERATOR/qtbindings && qmake && make

3) Run the test suite:

  Now it's time to run the test suite. Since the code relies on the bindings,
  it needs to find the location of the bindings generated above. This is done by
  setting an environment variable QSCRIPT_PLUGIN_PATH.

    $ QSCRIPT_PLUGIN_PATH=$QTSCRIPTGENERATOR/plugins ./TestLoading

(cd $QTSCRIPTGENERATOR/generator && qmake && make && ./generator) || exit
(cd ../qtbindings && echo -e "TEMPLATE=subdirs\nSUBDIRS=qtscript_core qtscript_gui qs_eval" > qtbindings.pro && qmake && make) || exit
export QSCRIPT_PLUGIN_PATH=$QTSCRIPTGENERATOR/plugins
cd $YOUR_KOFFICE_BUILDDIR/libs/kotext/opendocument/tests && ./TestLoading
