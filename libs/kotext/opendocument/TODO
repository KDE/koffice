- shape can be anything, not only an image-shape but with the current KWFrame-design
    we need to special case them, or? well, probably it would be wise to refactor
    the KWFrame+KWFrameSet logic here...
            ==> DONE ? Now, we just use a KWFrame + KWFrameSet, no need for KWImageFrame for instance.
                ==> imho the best way to go in the long run.

- we also need to pass the used QTextCursor around to know in what KWFrameSet we are
    atm and where to write to. Or should we just use
    QTextCursor(m_loader->currentFrameset->document())
    each time and assume that we only need to append content anyway?

- bring back header+footers :)
    ==> loading works and saving is work under progress
    ==> support also page-styles with different headers/footers

- What about parent-styles aka style-inheritance? Does this REALLY work already?

- table-shape vs. QTextTable vs. the layout-hacks within the textshape is still a huge
    issue of it's own. http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=120574617208477&w=2 and
    http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=120582471310900&w=2

- unittests :)
    ==> see libs/kotext/opendocument/tests
    * anchors

- probably related to the crash with the OpenDoc1.1-specs;
    http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=121068865723376&w=2

- paragraph background-color does not work if the color is defined as style

- support loading+saving page-styles && add GUI-functionality to KWord for it
