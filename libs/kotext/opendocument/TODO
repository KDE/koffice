- pagestyles / masterpage(s)
    the way KWord deals with pages is broken by design cause ODF defines every
    formatting through styles while KWord doesn't understand the notion of page
    styles.
    ==> affects basicly all the current kword-code and need to be fixed before
        we build things on top of that broken design.
    ==> "2.8 Page Styles and Layout" + "14.4 Master Pages"

- text:soft-page-break is a KoTextInlineObject

- table-shape vs. QTextTable vs. the layout-hacks within the textshape is still a huge
    issue of it's own. http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=120574617208477&w=2 and
    http://lists.kde.org/?l=koffice-devel&m=120582471310900&w=2

- unittests :)
    ==> see libs/kotext/opendocument/tests
    we could need additional tests that do the loading+saving roundtrip and let us know what got lost

- implement all types of anchors
    load+save works, but UI and KoTextShapeContainerModel use only as-char anchors.

- What about parent-styles aka style-inheritance? Does this REALLY work already or do
  we only miss the UI for it?
