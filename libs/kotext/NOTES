Notes on KoText, ODF and Flake

== Embedded objects ==

* Flake offers already the possibility to embed shapes within shapes. Is
  this used?

* QTextDocument has a QTextObject class and a virtual createObject that
  can be used to embed any type of object inside a QTextDocument. Examples
  are QTextBlock and QTextFrame (QTextTable is derived from QTextFrame)

* KoText has KoInlineObject: for these objects, a unicode marker
  associated with a certain format is embedded in the QTextDocument. This
  char format has object type QTextFormat::UserObject + 1 and a
  certain id. The inline objects are also stored tracked by the
  KoInlineObjectManager.

* KWord has frames. Frames can contain shapes. See KoTextFrameLoader. Is
  this another way to anchor an inline shape inside a text shape? 

== Pagination ==

* No idea yet how pagination is done in KWord.
