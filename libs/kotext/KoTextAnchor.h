/**
 * This class is the object that is positioned in the text to be an anchor for a shape.
 * An anchor is the connection between the text-shape and the so called 'anchored-shape', where the
 * anchored shape can be any kind of shape.  This textanchor then connects the anchored-shape
 * to the text flow so the anchored shape can be repositioned on the canvas if new text is inserted
 * or removed before the anchor character.
 *
 * The KoTextAnchor object is inserted in text, and is represented to the user as one invisible character
 * in the text flow. Since this is a real character it will be positioned by the text-layout engine and
 * anything that will change the position of the text will thus also change the KoTextAnchor character.
 * In such a case where the KoTextAnchor character is repositioned the position of the anchored-frame
 * will also be reconsidered.
 *
 * The anchored shape will be positioned (in supporting applications) based on the properties set on the
 * anchor.  The setAlignment(AnchorVertical) and setAlignment(AnchorHorizontal) calls will determine the
 * resulting position relative to the position the KoTextAnchor character.
 *
 * Steps to use a KoTextAnchor are; <ol>
 * <li> Create a new instance with e.g. new KoTextAnchor(myshape);
 * <li> Use loadOdfFromShape() to load additional attributes like the "text:anchor-type"
 * <li> Position the anchor with updatePosition() what will attach the KoTextAnchor-instance to
 *    the TextShape's \a KoTextShapeContainerModel . </ol>
 * The position of the shape relative to the anchor is called the offset. It's loaded by loadOdfFromShape().
 * @see KWAnchorStrategy for more information about the layout of anchors/shapes in KWord.
