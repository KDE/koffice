 * list. A scheme that will be familiar to many lisp programmers
 * car/cdr. Unfortunately dealing with such lists directly is
 * clumsy so this and loadList() let you store a list of data
 * nodes and these methods create all the boilerplate Rdf triples
 * to store/read a simple QList of nodes to Rdf properly. You
 * supply the list header node ListHeadSubject which is normally
 * the subject that you want the list associated with in Rdf. The
 * other nodes used in the internal structure of the Rdf list are
 * just random bnodes as shown below. If you have a previous,
 * existing list then this method will remove those nodes first so
 * that the Rdf model does not grow with disgarded list nodes over
 * time.
 *
 * The old list nodes are removed if they exist, and a new list is
 * created starting at ListHeadSubject, and linking all the nodes
 * in dataBNodeList using the supplied rdf context. Use the
 * loadList() method to get the list dataBNodeList back from the
 * model again.
 *
 * The result will be like:
 * ListHeadSubject 22-rdf-syntax-ns#first dataBNodeList[0]
 * ListHeadSubject 22-rdf-syntax-ns#rest  bnodeA
 * bnodeA          22-rdf-syntax-ns#first dataBNodeList[1]
