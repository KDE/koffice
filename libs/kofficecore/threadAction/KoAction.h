/**
 * This class represent the glue between a user event and a piece of controlling logic.
 * Events based programming creates the need to execute certain pieces of logic based
 * on the incoming event, conveniently grouped per action. An action can be something
 * like 'print'.
 * This action uses a ThreadWeaver object to handle the actions and therefor this
 * action is implicitly multithreading.
 * Example usage:
 * @code
    Action *myAction = new Action();
    myAction->setWeaver(m_weaver);
    myAction->connect(myAction, SIGNAL(triggered(const QVariant&)),
        target, SLOT(slot()), Qt::DirectConnection);

    myAction->execute();
 * @endcode
 * In this example the method 'slot' will be called each time
 * the 'execute()' method is called on the action. It will be called in a different
 * thread from the main thread and you get the guarantee that it will
 * never be called before a previous call has ended.
 * The execute() method can be called from any thread to simply move control to
 * an anonymous thread.
 *
 * Notice that the default version uses the SimpleQueuedPolicy.
