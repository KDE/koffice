/**
 * Helper class around KoStore for writing out OASIS files.
 * This class helps solving the problem that automatic styles must be before
 * the body, but it's easier to iterate over the application's objects only
 * once. So we open a KoXmlWriter into a memory buffer, write the body into it,
 * collect automatic styles while doing that, write out automatic styles,
 * and then copy the body XML from the buffer into the real KoXmlWriter.
 *
 * The typical use of this class is therefore:
 *   - write body into bodyWriter() and collect auto styles
 *   - write auto styles into contentWriter()
 *   - call closeContentWriter()
 *   - write other files into the store (styles.xml, settings.xml etc.)
 *
 *
 * TODO: maybe we could encapsulate a bit more things, to e.g. handle
 * adding manifest entries automatically.
