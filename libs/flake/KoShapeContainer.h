/**
 * This is the base class that all Flake group-shapes are based on.
 * Extending from this class allows you to have child-shapes.
 * Like the KoShape class, this shape is a visible class with
 * a position and a size. It can paint itself as well if you implement
 * the paintComponent() method.
 *
 * <p>The most important feature of this class is that you can make
 * other KoShape classes to be children of this container.
 *
 * <p>The effect of grouping those shapes is that their position
 * is relative to the position of the container. Move the container and
 * all children move with it.
 *
 * <p>Each child can optionally be said to be 'clipped' by the container.
 * This feature will give the effect that if the child has a size and
 * position outside the container, parts outside the container will not be shown.
 * This is especially useful
 * for showing cutouts of content, like images, without changing the actual content.
 *
 * <p>For so called clipped children any modification made to the container is
 * propagated to the child. This includes rotation as well as scaling
 * and shearing.
 *
 * <p>Maintaining the list of children can be done using the supplied methods
 * addChild() and removeChild(). However, they only forward their requests to the
 * data model KoShapeContainerModel and if you provide a custom implementation
 * of that model any means can be used to maintain a list of children, as long as
 * you will take care to register them with the appropriate shape manager.
 *
 * <p>An example usage where a custom model might be useful is when you have a
 * container for text areas which are split into columns.  If you resize the container
 * and the width of the individual columns gets too small, the model can choose to
 * remove a child or add one when the width allows another column.
