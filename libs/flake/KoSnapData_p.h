/**
 * This class is used to provide additional data to the snap guide.
 *
 * Some shapes might have internal data it wants snapping support for,
 * i.e. the axis of a chart shape, the row of a table shape, etc.
 * As the data is internal and special to that shape, the snap guide
 * does not know about it and can therefore not provide any snapping
 * to it.
 * So the shape can put that data in form of points or segments into
 * that class which the snap guide can retrieve and use accordingly.
