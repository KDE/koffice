 * Class meant to hold the full image data so it can be shared between image shapes.
 * In KOffice there is a picture shape and a krita shape which both can both show
 * an image.  To allow smooth transition of image data between shapes, as well as allowing
 * lower-resolution data to be shown this class will actually be the backing store of
 * the image data and it can create a pre-rendered QPixmap without deminishing the backing-store
 * data.
 * This class inherits from KoShapeUserData which means you can set it on any KoShape using
 * KoShape::setUserData() and get it using KoShape::userData().  The pictureshape plugin should
 * use this class' API to show its image data.
 * Such plugins are suggested to not make a copy of the pixmap data, but use the fact that this
 * image data caches one for every request to pixmap()
