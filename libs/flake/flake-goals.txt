The goals of this library are to have in all KOffice application
that can use graphical objects like clip-art, stencils, borders,
animations, embedded movies and whatever:

Common object handling in all applications:
  the same user interface for creation, selection, moving,
  resizing, snapping to rulers and guides etc. This is the big
  thing: all KOffice applications should work the same way,
  have the same interaction model for working with component.

A simple object hierarchy with a common manipulatable base
  object class and subclasses for svg objects, lines, movies,
  embedded documents and text objects. Svg objects and lines
  should always have the option of an associated text object.

Color management (may be hard to achieve with Arthur)

Connectors and snapping

Excellent printing

The possibility of adding high-level behavior to objects
(click on an object and move to another page in Kivio).

Copy and paste and drag and drop in and between applications

Saveable in OASIS

Inspector widgets

Undo and redo (of course)

The objects render themselves to a QPainter

Oh, and while we're at it, make sure we all use KoRuler (and
reprogram that one where needed), shall we?

What we don't want to do is:

KOffice independent. Initially it will be, because we're
developing on Qt4, but it's no hard requirement, unless
people from outside KOffice start helping and hacking, perhaps.

No canvas. This is no canvas library: every application will have
a canvas optimized for the kind of things it needs to do (although
Karbon14 and Kivio will merge their canvas and use the same thing.)

Creation of complex svg itself: use Karbon14 or Inkscape for that
Save in KOffice's old file format
