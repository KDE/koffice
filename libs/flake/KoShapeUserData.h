/**
 * The KoShapeUserData class is used to associate custom data with a shape.
 *
 *  KoShapeUserData provides an abstract interface for container classes
 *  that are used to associate application-specific user data with shapes in KoShape
 *  Generally, subclasses of this class provide functions to allow data to
 *  be stored and retrieved, and instances are attached to KoShape using
 *  KoShape::setUserData(). This makes it possible to store additional data per
 *  shape in a way that allows applications to not know the implementation of a
 *  specific KoShape extending class.
 *
 *  Each subclass should provide a reimplementation of the destructor to ensure that
 *  any private data is automatically cleaned up when user data objects are deleted.
 *
 *  Please note that this object is a QObject to allow a
 *  <code>qobject_cast<MyData*> (shape->userData())</code> to work which is useful in an environment
 *  where classes from plugins may not be castable using a static_cast or a dynamic_cast
