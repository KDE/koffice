For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

Some suggestions discussed on IRC:
- add position input for selected path point in the path tool widget


* KoShapeBorderModel should have a shared private object, just like KoShape
  Subclasses like the lineBorder can then make their private inherit from the
  KoShapeBorderModel's private.
* KoShapeBorderModel should be renamed to KoShapeBorderBase
