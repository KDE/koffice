For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

Some suggestions discussed on IRC:
- mouse wheel for zoom in and out, middle mouse button for panning in the default tool
- better grouping of flake tools
- use the status bar to show some context info
- have the toolbox layout tools in single column
- add position input for selected path point in the path tool widget
- visualized handle size is always the same, but hit range is bigger
