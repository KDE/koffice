For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

* For shapes that are scaled to a negative size (using setScale) the interaction tool doesn't work
  properly anymore. Moving the mouse left makes the action go right. And visa versa.
* Add shadow to a KoShape
  - shadow properties as described by the odf spec are (offsetx, offsety, color, opacity)
    -> maybe have a KoShapeShadow class to hold these
  - painting done in the shape itself. The angle is set in the document space, not in the shape-coordianate system
  - on insert into the rTree (KoShapeManager) extend the boudingrect with shadow (note that KoShapeManager is
    a friend of KoShape).
