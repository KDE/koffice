For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

* Allow the setting of a QPainterPath to the CreateShape which is then displayed (and
  scaled etc) instead of the rubberband.  The rubberband is still used if no painterPath is set.
* Fix scale strategy so it will not create zero sized objects.  Negative size is allowed, though.
* Add shadow to a KoShape
  - shadow properties as described by the odf spec are (offsetx, offsety, color, opacity)
    -> maybe have a KoShapeShadow class to hold these
  - painting done in the shape itself. The angle is set in the document space, not in the shape-coordianate system
  - on insert into the rTree (KoShapeManager) extend the boudingrect with shadow (note that KoShapeManager is
    a friend of KoShape).
