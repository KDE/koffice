For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

* For shapes that are scaled to a negative size (using setScale) the interaction tool doesn't work
  properly anymore. Moving the mouse left makes the action go right. And visa versa.
* Add shadow to a KoShape
  - shadow properties as described by the odf spec are (offsetx, offsety, color, opacity)
    -> maybe have a KoShapeShadow class to hold these
  - painting done in the shape itself. The angle is set in the document space, not in the shape-coordianate system
  - on insert into the rTree (KoShapeManager) extend the boudingrect with shadow (note that KoShapeManager is
    a friend of KoShape).


* Add a way to make sure a shape will never be printed partially due to it still doing work
  for example by a kexi shape downloading data before it will show that.
  Proposed Method in KoShape:
    /**
     * A shape can be in a state that its doing loading or text layout or similar in which case
     * it can be shown on screen just fine (probably partially) but it should really not be printed
     * until its fully done.
     * Flake will call this method from a non-main thread and only start printing it when the
     * method returned.
     * Warning!  This method can be blocking for a long time, never call it on the gui-thread!
     * @param pi the progress indicator class that can be used to set status information and / or
     *        progress on which will be displayed while waiting.
     */
    virtual void waitUntilReady(KoProgressIndicator *pi) const {}
