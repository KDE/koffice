For anyone that wants to hack on flake here is a list of things that need to be done;

* Add 'ensureVisible(KoShape)' to KoCanvasController (see QScrollArea for what it should do)
* Allow the setting of a QPainterPath to the CreateShape which is then displayed (and
  scaled etc) instead of the rubberband.  The rubberband is still used if no painterPath is set.
* CreateTool (probably in the strategy) should create actions and add them to the canvasBase
  on creation of a shape.
* Fix scale strategy so it will not create zero sized objects.  Negative size is allowed, though.
