* Add Commands
  * KoShapeDelete
    Have a bool in this command to see if on destructor we did an execute/unexecute
    last and thus need to delete the KoShape.
    Note that we want a refCounter in the model-backend of the Shape. (picture/text)
* add a ShearingStrategy


Bugs:
* rescaling does not alter the positions of the connectors. I expect their
  relative position to the whole shape to stay the same.
* selecting an object does not draw the handles correctly until you had a
  mouseevent that triggers a repaint.
