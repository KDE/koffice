/**
 *
 * Base class for all flake objects. Flake objects extend this class
 * to allow themselves to be manipulated. This class just represents
 * a graphical shape in the document and can be manipulated by some default
 * tools in this library.
 *
 * <p>Due to the limited responsibility of this class, the extending object
 * can have any data backend and is responsible for painting itself.
 *
 * <p>We strongly suggest that any extending class will use a Model View
 * Controller (MVC) design where the View part is all in this class, as well
 * as the one that inharits from this one.  This allows the data that rests
 * in the model to be reused in different parts of the document. For example
 * by having two flake objects that show it. Or each showing a section of it.
 *
 * <p>The KoShape data is completely in postscript-points (pt) (see KoUnit
 * for conversion methods to and from pt).
 *
 * <p>Flake objects can be created in three ways: 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a simple new KoDerivedFlake(),
 *   <li>through an associated tool,
 *   <li>through a factory
 * </ul>
