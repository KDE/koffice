 * of which can be used to start or end a connection.  Consider an shape in the form of a man.
 * You would call KoShape::addConnectionPoint() with a point where his hand is.  If you have a

    Add a strategy for InteractionTool that when it selects a connection it can be used to change

    Should we have a way to segment the repaint-rects of the connection?  Now if we have a long connection
      the repaint rect will be huge due to us using the plain bounding rect.  It might be useful to return
      a list of QRectFs which each will be redrawn. Allowing for a substantially smaller repaint area.

    Should I remove a shapeConnection from the ShapeManager on destruction?
