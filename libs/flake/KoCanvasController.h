/**
 * This widget is a wrapper around your canvas providing scrollbars.
 * Flake does not provide a canvas, the application will have to
 * extend a QWidget and implement that themselves; but Flake does make
 * it a lot easier to do so. One of those things is this widget that
 * acts as a decorator around the canvas widget and provides
 * scrollbars and allows the canvas to be centered in the viewArea
 * <p>The using application can intantiate this class and add its
 * canvas using the setCanvas() call. Which is designed so it can be
 * called multiple times for those that wish to exchange one canvas
 * widget for another.
 *
 * Effectively, there is _one_ KoCanvasController per KoView in your
 * application.
 *
 * The canvas widget is at most as big as the viewport of the scroll
 * area, and when the view on the document is near its edges, smaller.
 * In your canvas widget code, you can find the right place in your
 * document in pixel coordinates by adding the documentOffset
