 * Provide grouping for shapes.
 * The group shape allows you to add children which will then be grouped in selections
 * and actions.
 * <p>If you have a set of shapes that together make up a bigger shape it is often
 * useful to group them together so the user will perceive the different shapes as
 * actually being one.  This means that if the user clicks on one shape, all shapes
 * in the group will be selected at once, making the tools that works on
 * selections alter all of them at the same time.
 * <p>Note that while this object is also a shape, it is not actually visible and the user
 * can't interact with it.
