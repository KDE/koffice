/**
 * The interaction tool adds to the normal KoTool class the concept of strategies
 * as a means to get one tool to have different actions the user can perform using the mouse.
 * Each time the user presses the mouse until she releases the mouse a strategy object
 * will be created, used and disgarded.
 * If the usage of a tool fits this pattern you need to inherit from this class instead of the
 * plain KoTool and reimplement your createStrategy() method which returns a tool-specific
 * strategy where all the real interaction code is placed.
 * A tool can then become as simple as this;
 * @code
    class MyTool : public KoInteractionTool
    {
    public:
        MyTool::MyTool(KoCanvasBase *canvas) : KoInteractionTool( canvas ) { }

        KoInteractionStrategy *MyTool::createStrategy(KoPointerEvent *event) {
            return new MyStrategy(this, m_canvas, event->point);
        }
    };
 * @endcode
 * Whereas your strategy (MyStrategy in the example) will contain the interaction code.
