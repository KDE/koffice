/**
 * This namespace contains a few convenience functions to simplify code using QDom
 * (when loading OASIS documents, in particular).
 *
 * To find the child element with a given name, use KoDom::namedItemNS.
 *
 * To find all child elements with a given name, use
 * QDomElement e;
 * forEachElement( e, parent )
 * {
 *     if ( e.localName() == "..." && e.namespaceURI() == KoXmlNS::... )
 *     {
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * Note that this means you don't ever need to use QDomNode nor toElement anymore!
 * Also note that localName is the part without the prefix, this is the whole point
 * of namespace-aware methods.
 *
 * To find the attribute with a given name, use QDomElement::attributeNS.
 *
 * Do not use getElementsByTagNameNS, it's recursive (which is never needed in KOffice).
 * Do not use tagName() or nodeName() or prefix(), since the prefix isn't fixed.
