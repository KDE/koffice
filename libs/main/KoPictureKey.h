 *
 * @note We use the *nix epoch (1970-01-01) as a time base because it is a valid date.
 * That way we do not depend on a behaviour of the current QDateTime that might change in future versions of Qt
 * and we are also nice to non-Qt programs wanting to read KOffice's files.
 *
 * @note This behaviour is also needed for re-saving KWord files having \<FORMAT id="2"\>. When saving again,
 * these files get a \<KEY\> element as child of \<PIXMAPS\> but not one as child of \<FORMAT\> and \<IMAGE\>.
 * Therefore we need to be careful that the key remains compatible to default values
 * (another good reason for the *NIX epoch)
 *
 * @note In case of a remote path, the "original path" is the name of the temporary file that was
 *  used to download the file.
