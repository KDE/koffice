 * macro in your class even if you don't use signals or slots.
 * This is needed as filters are created on the fly.
 * The m_chain member allows access to the @ref KoFilterChain

 *
 * @note Take care: The m_chain pointer is invalid while the constructor
 * runs due to the implementation -- @em don't use it in the constructor.
 * After the constructor, when running the @ref convert() method it's
 * guaranteed to be valid, so no need to check against 0.

/**
 * The base class for all @em import filters embedding other filters. Right
 * now we don't support embedding for export filters, but if there's a
 * request for that feature please don't hesitate to contact Werner Trobin
 * <trobin@kde.org>.
 *
 * To make use of embedding features you have to know that there are two kinds
 * of embedding for filters: embedding the output of a different filter (library)
 * or embedding the output of several internal filters (no separate library).
 * The first case is the simpler one. You just have to override savePartContents()
 * and call @ref #embedPart to trigger the embedding process. One example for such
 * a filter is Kontour's MSOD (MS Office Drawing) filter.
 *
 * The more complex case is embedding various streams from within the same filter
 * library. This is necessary for OLE like files (at least with the current design
 * of the OLEFilter). In this case you have to use @ref #startInternalEmbedding and
 * @ref #endInternalEmbedding accordingly. Try to use the previous method if possible.
 *
 * If you're using this class you can also setup a signal/slot communication
 * between parent and child filter. To make that work you simply have to define
 * signals and slots along the following rules:
 * Signals should be named "commSignal\<name\>" where \<name\> is the name of the signal,
 * slots should be named "commSlot\<name\>". The connection will be done automatically
 * if names and signatures are matching.
