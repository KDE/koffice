/**
 * Model class for use with KoDocumentSectionView. The document
 * sections that an application uses need to inherit from this class
 * to be displayable in the KoDocumentSectionView. That would be,
 * for instance, pages in KWord or KPresenter, layers in Krita or
 * Karbon, sheets in KSpread.
 *
 * The KoDocumentSectionView will display a thumbnail and a row of
 * icon properties for every document section.
 *
 * KoDocumentSectionModel is separate from the flake hierarchy:
 * documents sections are things like layers, sheets or pages, i.e., a
 * shape can cover more than one section, and a section can contain
 * many shapes or part of shapes.)
 *
 * See also the Qt documentation for QAbstractItemModel. This class
 * only extends that interface to provide a name and set of toggle
 * properties (like visible, locked, selected -- let your imagination
 * run riot).
 *
 * See for an example implementation KisLayer.
 *
 * Your class also needs to implement the following pure abstract
 * virtuals from QAbstractItemModel:
@code

    virtual int rowCount(const QModelIndex &parent = QModelIndex()) const;

    virtual int columnCount(const QModelIndex &parent = QModelIndex()) const;

    virtual QModelIndex index(int row, int column, const QModelIndex &parent = QModelIndex()) const;

    virtual QModelIndex parent(const QModelIndex &index) const;

    virtual QVariant data(const QModelIndex &index, int role = Qt::DisplayRole) const;

    virtual Qt::ItemFlags flags(const QModelIndex &index) const;

    virtual bool setData(const QModelIndex &index, const QVariant &value, int role = Qt::EditRole);
