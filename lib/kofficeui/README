To install the KOffice-UserInterface library do:

First of all compile and install the kofficecore library.

cd pics
make install
cd ..
make depend
make all
make install

If you want to compile the test program, with which
you can open all dialogs of the library do:

cd test
make depend
make all
./test

Before all dialogs in 'test' run, you must install the KParts.
