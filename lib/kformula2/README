This code is in pre-alpha stage.

This is the new kformula library, it will use code from old koffice/kformula
it will be used by kformula part and in the future it may replace the 
libkformula.

To test the library do
make kformulatest
./kformulatest

Supported actions include:

Ctrl-O                  open (to "test.xml")
Ctrl-S                  save (from "test.xml")
Ctrl-M			open (from "mathml.xml")
Ctrl-Q                  quit

Ctrl-Z                  undo
Ctrl-Shift-Z            redo

Ctrl-X                  cut
Ctrl-C                  copy
Ctrl-V                  paste
Ctrl-A                  selectAll

Ctrl-U                  upper index (symbol/root)
Ctrl-L                  lower index (symbol)

Ctrl-1                  sum
Ctrl-2                  product
Ctrl-3                  integral
Ctrl-4                  root
Ctrl-5                  fraction
Ctrl-6                  matrix
Ctrl-D, Ctrl-R          remove enclosing element
Ctrl-G                  make current letter a greek one

^, _, Ctrl-^, Ctrl-_    standart indexes
(, [, |                 brackets

Text, numbers and operators are supported as well.

Please note that the key bindings are for testing only. The library
is meant to be used with KActions. Look at KFormulaDocument::createActions.


And yes, we do have syntax highlighting! Just type:

y = e ^ - o m e g a <space> t <space> ( a * s i n ( o m e g a <space> t <space> + b * c o s ( o m e g a <space> t

or, if you prefer

s i n <space> ^ 2 <space> ( a l p h a <space> <space> + c o s <space> ^ 2 <space> ( a l p h a <space> <space> = 1

There is some truth in it!


Hint: Press <space> on a name that is not a symbol to select it.

Hint: If you don't want to separate your names with operators, you
might use the backslash instead.
