things/bugs/issues that need to be fixed for 2.0 (1.0), IMHO

- make sure all apps support calling load() multiple times on the same
  document (kword and kpresenter leak tons of memory for example)

- KoDocument::createShell is a big problem when calling it for an
  embedded document, as the created object (shell) is not registered
  with KLibLoader/KLibrary. Therefore theoretically KLibLoader might
  attempt to close the library while there might still be a shell object
  from that library be "active" .
  workaround (?) : make sure that when the document dies, all associated
  shells die, too.
  (so the document keeps a list of shells, instead of using the qobj
   hierarchy/tree)

- container states are not saved/restored when using embedded parts,
  as they are stored in the view, which gets destroyed when being deactivated
  (fix: store the data in the document; problem: how to identify views?)
