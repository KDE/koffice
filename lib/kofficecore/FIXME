things/bugs/issues that need to be fixed for 2.0 (1.0), IMHO

- make sure all apps support calling load() multiple times on the same
  document (kword and kpresenter leak tons of memory for example)

- container states are not saved/restored when using embedded parts,
  as they are stored in the view, which gets destroyed when being deactivated
  (fix: store the data in the document; problem: how to identify views?)

- make all KOffice components allocate a KAboutData instance
  (and free it correctly upon destruction of the factory)
