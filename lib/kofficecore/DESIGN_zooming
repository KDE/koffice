There are two kinds of zooming:
 
1) View Zooming:
This kind of zooming is only done by full KoViews, regardless
whether they are the root views (not embedded), or they are
*active* embedded views. There only has to be a KoView object.
 
There is *one* zoom factor for both axes (x/y) and the whole
content (text, objects, children,...) is zoomed accordingly.
 
This kind of zooming is like the zoom support you know from
other applications.
 
 
2) Child Zooming:
Imagine you'd like to show a certain part of an embedded
document, but you have to fill a specified area. At the
moment this is "impossible" (we know that it's kind of
possible, but it's not straightforward) because when you
resize the child's frame, the contents resize, too. Due
to that you see more of the child's content :)
 
The solution will be: If you simply resize a frame, the
child document will resize, too, and show more contents.
If you press Alt/Meta during resizing, the child's
content will stay the same, but it will be zoomed to
fit the rectangle you specify.
Pressing Shift gives you a constant width/height ratio
during resizing.
Pressing Alt+Shift is allowed, too.
 
As you already know we'll support a zoom factor for
each axe here. (i.e. x/y zoom factors)
