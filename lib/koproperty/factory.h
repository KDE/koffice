//! \brief Manages factories providing custom editors and properties.
/*! This class is static, you don't need to create an instance of it. It's used to enable the
     custom property/editors system.
     You may want to create your own property types and/or editors to:

     - Create your own editors for some special kind of properties, not included in
       KProperty basic editors;

     - Create composed properties, which contain more than one value. Child
       items will then be created in the Editor (that's how rect, size properties are created).

     \section custom_prop Using Custom Properties
     To create a custom property, create a subclass of \ref CustomProperty class. You need to implement
     some virtual functions, to customise the behaviour of your property 
     (see \ref CustomProperty api doc).
     If you create a composed property, both parent and children properties must have custom 
     (different) types. \n
     Then, you need to register the new created type, using \ref registerFactoryForProperty(). 
     The second parameter is an instance of CustomPropertyFactory-derived class 
     implementing createCustomProperty() method.\n
     To create a property of this type, just use the normal constructor, overriding 
     the type parameter with the type you registered.

     \section custom_editor Using Custom Editors
     First, create a subclass of Widget, and implement all the virtuals you need to tweak
     the property editor. You can find examples of editors in the src/editors/ directory.\n
     Then, register it using \ref registerFactoryForEditor(), as for properties (see test/ dir 
     for an example of custom editor). You can also register a new editor for a basic type, 
     if the basic editor doesn't fit your needs (if you have created a better editor, 
     send us the code, and it may get included in KProperty library).\n
     Every time a property of this type is created, createCustomWidget() method for 
     the custom CustomPropertyFactory-derived factory object you registered will be called 
     to create the custom editor widget item.
