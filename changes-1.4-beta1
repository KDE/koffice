New applications: krita, kexi

Krita
=====

Krita is an image editor and paint application with a wide range of
applications, from photo editing to the creation of original artwork.
Sporting a clear and uncluttered interface (for a paint app...) it makes the
features it delivers accessible and intuitive to use.

This is the first public release of Krita and while it provides a coherent set
of features, it is only the first stepping stone towards a flexible paint
application for artists and image editors.

Krita offers:

* Layers (without fixed boundaries).
* A familiar set of tools -- brushes, selection tools and shape tools.
* Painting with filters.
* An extensible system for the addition of new color and paint models.
* Support for pressure sensitive tablets.
* The ability to read most graphics file formats, including gimp and photoshop files.
* Exporting to many graphics file formats (but not gimp or photoshop)
* A complete colour management system based on lcms.
* A useful set of filters (implemented as plugins, so the set of filters
  is extensible) including a CImg based image restoration plugin.
* The ability to use Gimp palettes, brushes, patterns and gradients

Caveats:

* In this beta version exif data embedded in jpeg images is not preserved.
* Some tools and menu options do not yet function completely correctly.

Kexi   [ this is from http://www.kexi-project.org/wiki/wikiview/index.php?AnnouncementForKOffice1.4 ]
====

KOffice 1.4 is the first official release to include Kexi - the KOffice database management application. 
 Kexi is an integrated environment for managing data. It can be used for creating database schemas; inserting data; performing queries, and processing data. Forms can be created to provide a custom interface to your data. All database objects - tables, queries and forms - are stored in the database, making it easy to share databases. 

 Kexi is considered as a long awaited Open Source competitor for MS Access, Filemaker and Oracle Forms. Its development is motivated by the lack of Rapid Application Development (RAD) tools for database systems that are sufficiently powerful, inexpensive, open standards driven and portable across many OSes and hardware platforms.

Overview 
 Supports database storage in files and on database servers. 
 Graphical interface for creating and altering table structures. 
 Form entry, with visual form designer. 
 Advanced tabular data view. 
 Intuitive query designer - no knowledge of SQL required! 
 Integrated SQL Editor available for advanced users.

Data Processing and Access 
 Data migration from MySQL, PostgreSQL and MS Access databases (MS Access available as an external plugin). 
 KexiDB API available for developers for integration with other applications. 
 Scripting support with Python language - hidden for 0.1 version. 
 (JavaScript/ECMA-Script support is planned) 
 Easy data report generation (planned). 

Database Storage 
 Kexi can store databases in files and on database servers, while providing a common user interface. Database drivers for the following database engines are available: 
 - SQLite (Native file format: version 2 and 3) 
 - PostgreSQL 
 - MySQL 
 Support for other database systems is planned for future versions, including the ODBC interface, for simpler and more flexible integration in corporate environments.
