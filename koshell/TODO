Plans for KoKoolBar : splitter mode

KoKoolBarGroup : 
 Change = Button always at the top, in splitter mode

KoKoolBarBox : widget containing the items 
               (previously: 'of the active group').

KoKoolBar : holds a QSplitter and two instances of KoKoolBarBox instead of one.

 It should have
>an indicator which document is the current one, it should make keypresses
>visible like QIconView does, it should allow renaming of documents and it
>should allow Drag and Drop :)

-> use QIconView
